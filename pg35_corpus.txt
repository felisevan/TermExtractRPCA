recondite matter to us His pale grey eyes shone andtwinkled and his usually pale face was flushed and animated The fireburnt brightly and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in thelilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in ourglasses Our chairs being his patents embraced and caressed us ratherthan submitted to be sat upon and there was that luxuriousafterdinner atmosphere when thought runs gracefully free of thetrammels of precision And he put it to us in this waymarking thepoints with a lean forefingeras we sat and lazily admired hisearnestness over this new paradox as we thought it and his fecundityYou must follow me carefully I shall have to controvert one or twoideas that are almost universally accepted The geometry for instancethey taught you at school is founded on a misconceptionIs not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon saidFilby an argumentative person with red hairI do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable groundfor it You will soon admit as much as I need from you You know ofcourse that a mathematical line a line of thickness _nil_ has no realexistence They taught you that Neither has a mathematical planeThese things are mere abstractionsThat is all right said the PsychologistNor having only length breadth and thickness can a cube have areal existenceThere I object said Filby Of course a solid body may exist Allreal thingsSo most people think But wait a moment Can an _instantaneous_ cubeexistDont follow you said FilbyCan a cube that does not last for any time at all have a realexistenceFilby became pensive Clearly the Time Traveller proceeded anyreal body must have extension in _four_ directions it must haveLength Breadth Thickness andDuration But through a naturalinfirmity of the flesh which I will explain to you in a moment weincline to overlook this fact There are really four dimensions threewhich we call the three planes of Space and a fourth Time There ishowever a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the formerthree dimensions and the latter because it happens that ourconsciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latterfrom the beginning to the end of our livesThat said a very young man making spasmodic efforts to relight hiscigar over the lamp that    very clear indeedNow it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlookedcontinued the Time Traveller with a slight accession of cheerfulnessReally this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension though somepeople who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it Itis only another way of looking at Time _There is no difference betweenTime and any of the three dimensions of Space except that ourconsciousness moves along it_ But some foolish people have got hold ofthe wrong side of that idea You have all heard what they have to sayabout this Fourth Dimension_I_ have not said the Provincial MayorIt is simply this That Space as our mathematicians have it isspoken of as having three dimensions which one may call LengthBreadth and Thickness and is always definable by reference to threeplanes each at right angles to the others But some philosophicalpeople have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularlywhy notanother direction at right angles to the other threeand have eventried to construct a FourDimensional geometry Professor Simon Newcombwas expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a monthor so ago You know how on a flat surface which has only twodimensions we can represent a figure of a threedimensional solid andsimilarly they think that by models of three dimensions they couldrepresent one of fourif they could master the perspective of thething SeeI think so murmured the Provincial Mayor and knitting his browshe lapsed into an introspective state his lips moving as one whorepeats mystic words Yes I think I see it now he said after sometime brightening in a quite transitory mannerWell I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometryof Four Dimensions for some time Some of my results are curious Forinstance here is a portrait of a man at eight years old another atfifteen another at seventeen another at twentythree and so on Allthese are evidently sections as it were ThreeDimensionalrepresentations of his FourDimensioned being which is a fixed andunalterable thingScientific people proceeded the Time Traveller after the pauserequired for the proper assimilation of this know very well that Timeis only a kind of Space Here is a popular scientific diagram aweather record This line I trace with my finger shows the movement ofthe barometer Yesterday it was so high yesterday night it fell thenthis morning it rose again and so gently upward to here Surely themercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Spacegenerally recognised But certainly it traced such a line and thatline therefore we must conclude was along the TimeDimensionBut said the Medical Man staring hard at a coal in the fire ifTime is really only a fourth dimension of Space why is it and why hasit always been regarded as something different And why cannot we movein Time as we move about in the other dimensions of SpaceThe Time Traveller smiled Are you so sure we can move freely inSpace Right and left we can go backward and forward freely enoughand men always have done so I admit we move freely in two dimensionsBut how about up and down Gravitation limits us thereNot exactly said the Medical Man There are balloonsBut before the balloons save for spasmodic jumping and theinequalities of the surface man had no freedom of vertical movementStill they could move a little up and down said the Medical ManEasier far easier down than upAnd you cannot move at all in Time you cannot get away from thepresent momentMy dear sir that is just where you are wrong That is just where thewhole world has gone wrong We are always getting away from the presentmoment Our mental existences which are immaterial and have nodimensions are passing along the TimeDimension with a uniformvelocity from the cradle to the grave Just as we should travel _down_if we began our existence fifty miles above the earths surfaceBut the great difficulty is this interrupted the Psychologist You_can_ move about in all directions of Space but you cannot move aboutin TimeThat is the germ of my great discovery But you are wrong to say thatwe cannot move about in Time For instance if I am recalling anincident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence Ibecome absentminded as you say I jump back for a moment Of coursewe have no means of staying back for any length of Time any more thana savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground But acivilised man is better off than the savage in this respect He can goup against gravitation in a balloon and why should he not hope thatultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along theTimeDimension or even turn about and travel the other wayOh _this_ began Filby is allWhy not said the Time TravellerIts against reason said FilbyWhat reason said the Time TravellerYou can show black is white by argument said Filby but you willnever convince mePossibly not said the Time Traveller But now you begin to see theobject of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions Longago I had a vague inkling of a machineTo travel through Time exclaimed the Very Young ManThat shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time asthe driver determinesFilby contented himself with laughterBut I have experimental verification said the Time TravellerIt would be remarkably convenient for the historian the Psychologistsuggested One might travel back and verify the accepted account ofthe Battle of Hastings for instanceDont you think you would attract attention said the Medical ManOur ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronismsOne might get ones Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato theVery Young Man thoughtIn which case they would certainly plough you for the Littlego TheGerman scholars have improved Greek so muchThen there is the future said the Very Young Man Just think Onemight invest all ones money leave it to accumulate at interest andhurry on aheadTo discover a society said I erected on a strictly communisticbasisOf all the wild extravagant theories began the PsychologistYes so it seemed to me and so I never talked of it untilExperimental verification cried I You are going to verify _that_The experiment cried Filby who was getting brainwearyLets see your experiment anyhow said the Psychologist though itsall humbug you knowThe Time Traveller smiled round at us Then still smiling faintly andwith his hands deep in his trousers pockets he walked slowly out ofthe room and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage tohis laboratoryThe Psychologist looked at us I wonder what hes gotSome sleightofhand trick or other said the Medical Man and Filbytried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem but before hehad finished his preface the Time Traveller came back and Filbysanecdote collapsed II The MachineThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallicframework scarcely larger than a small clock and very delicatelymade There was ivory in it and some transparent crystallinesubstance And now I must be explicit for this that followsunless hisexplanation is to be acceptedis an absolutely unaccountable thing Hetook one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about theroom and set it in front of the fire with two legs on the hearthrugOn this table he placed the mechanism Then he drew up a chair and satdown The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp thebright light of which fell upon the model There were also perhaps adozen candles about two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel andseveral in sconces so that the room was brilliantly illuminated I satin a low armchair nearest the fire and I drew this forward so as tobe almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace Filby satbehind him looking over his shoulder The Medical Man and theProvincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right thePsychologist from the left The Very Young Man stood behind thePsychologist We were all on the alert It appears incredible to methat any kind of trick however subtly conceived and however adroitlydone could have been played upon us under these conditionsThe Time Traveller looked at us and then at the mechanism Wellsaid the PsychologistThis little affair said the Time Traveller resting his elbows uponthe table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus is onlya model It is my plan for a machine to travel through time You willnotice that it looks singularly askew and that there is an oddtwinkling appearance about this bar as though it was in some wayunreal He pointed to the part with his finger Also here is onelittle white lever and here is anotherThe Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thingIts beautifully made he saidIt took two years to make retorted the Time Traveller Then when wehad all imitated the action of the Medical Man he said Now I wantyou clearly to understand that this lever being pressed over sendsthe machine gliding into the future and this other reverses themotion This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller PresentlyI am going to press the lever and off the machine will go It willvanish pass into future Time and disappear Have a good look at thething Look at the table too and satisfy yourselves there is notrickery I dont want to waste this model and then be told Im aquackThere was a minutes pause perhaps The Psychologist seemed about tospeak to me but changed his mind Then the Time Traveller put forthhis finger towards the lever No he said suddenly Lend me yourhand And turning to the Psychologist he took that individuals handin his own and told him to put out his forefinger So that it was thePsychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on itsinterminable voyage We all saw the lever turn I am absolutely certainthere was no trickery There was a breath of wind and the lamp flamejumped One of the candles on the mantel was blown out and the littlemachine suddenly swung round became indistinct was seen as a ghostfor a second perhaps as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivoryand it was gonevanished Save for the lamp the table was bareEveryone was silent for a minute Then Filby said he was damnedThe Psychologist recovered from his stupor and suddenly looked underthe table At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully Well hesaid with a reminiscence of the Psychologist Then getting up hewent to the tobacco jar on the mantel and with his back to us began tofill his pipeWe stared at each other Look here said the Medical Man are you inearnest about this Do you seriously believe that that machine hastravelled into timeCertainly said the Time Traveller stooping to light a spill at thefire Then he turned lighting his pipe to look at the Psychologistsface The Psychologist to show that he was not unhinged helpedhimself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut What is more I havea big machine nearly finished in therehe indicated thelaboratoryand when that is put together I mean to have a journey onmy own accountYou mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future saidFilbyInto the future or the pastI dont for certain know whichAfter an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration It must havegone into the past if it has gone anywhere he saidWhy said the Time TravellerBecause I presume that it has not moved in space and if it travelledinto the future it would still be here all this time since it musthave travelled through this timeBut said I If it travelled into the past it would have beenvisible when we came first into this room and last Thursday when wewere here and the Thursday before that and so forthSerious objections remarked the Provincial Mayor with an air ofimpartiality turning towards the Time TravellerNot a bit said the Time Traveller and to the Psychologist Youthink _You_ can explain that Its presentation below the thresholdyou know diluted presentationOf course said the Psychologist and reassured us Thats a simplepoint of psychology I should have thought of it Its plain enoughand helps the paradox delightfully We cannot see it nor can weappreciate this machine any more than we can the spoke of a wheelspinning or a bullet flying through the air If it is travellingthrough time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are if itgets through a minute while we get through a second the impression itcreates will of course be only onefiftieth or onehundredth of what itwould make if it were not travelling in time Thats plain enough Hepassed his hand through the space in which the machine had been Yousee he said laughingWe sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so Then the TimeTraveller asked us what we thought of it allIt sounds plausible enough tonight said the Medical Man but waituntil tomorrow Wait for the common sense of the morningWould you like to see the Time Machine itself asked the TimeTraveller And therewith taking the lamp in his hand he led the waydown the long draughty corridor to his laboratory I remember vividlythe flickering light his queer broad head in silhouette the dance ofthe shadows how we all followed him puzzled but incredulous and howthere in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the littlemechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes Parts were ofnickel parts of ivory parts had certainly been filed or sawn out ofrock crystal The thing was generally complete but the twistedcrystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets ofdrawings and I took one up for a better look at it Quartz it seemedto beLook here said the Medical Man are you perfectly serious Or isthis a tricklike that ghost you showed us last ChristmasUpon that machine said the Time Traveller holding the lamp aloftI intend to explore time Is that plain I was never more serious inmy lifeNone of us quite knew how to take itI caught Filbys eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man and hewinked at me solemnly III The Time Traveller ReturnsI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the TimeMachine The fact is the Time Traveller was one of those men who aretoo clever to be believed you never felt that you saw all round himyou always suspected some subtle reserve some ingenuity in ambushbehind his lucid frankness Had Filby shown the model and explained thematter in the Time Travellers words we should have shown _him_ farless scepticism For we should have perceived his motives aporkbutcher could understand Filby But the Time Traveller had morethan a touch of whim among his elements and we distrusted him Thingsthat would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in hishands It is a mistake to do things too easily The serious people whotook him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment they weresomehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him waslike furnishing a nursery with eggshell china So I dont think any ofus said very much about time travelling in the interval between thatThursday and the next though its odd potentialities ran no doubt inmost of our minds its plausibility that is its practicalincredibleness the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utterconfusion it suggested For my own part I was particularly preoccupiedwith the trick of the model That I remember discussing with theMedical Man whom I met on Friday at the Linnæan He said he had seen asimilar thing at Tübingen and laid considerable stress on theblowingout of the candle But how the trick was done he could notexplainThe next Thursday I went again to RichmondI suppose I was one of theTime Travellers most constant guestsand arriving late found four orfive men already assembled in his drawingroom The Medical Man wasstanding before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and hiswatch in the other I looked round for the Time Traveller andItshalfpast seven now said the Medical Man I suppose wed better havedinnerWheres said I naming our hostYouve just come Its rather odd Hes unavoidably detained He asksme in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if hes not back Sayshell explain when he comesIt seems a pity to let the dinner spoil said the Editor of awellknown daily paper and thereupon the Doctor rang the bellThe Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself whohad attended the previous dinner The other men were Blank the Editoraforementioned a certain journalist and anothera quiet shy man witha beardwhom I didnt know and who as far as my observation wentnever opened his mouth all the evening There was some speculation atthe dinnertable about the Time Travellers absence and I suggestedtime travelling in a halfjocular spirit The Editor wanted thatexplained to him and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account ofthe ingenious paradox and trick we had witnessed that day week Hewas in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridoropened slowly and without noise I was facing the door and saw itfirst Hallo I said At last And the door opened wider and theTime Traveller stood before us I gave a cry of surprise Goodheavens man whats the matter cried the Medical Man who saw himnext And the whole tableful turned towards the doorHe was in an amazing plight His coat was dusty and dirty and smearedwith green down the sleeves his hair disordered and as it seemed tome greyereither with dust and dirt or because its colour had actuallyfaded His face was ghastly pale his chin had a brown cut on ita cuthalfhealed his expression was haggard and drawn as by intensesuffering For a moment he hesitated in the doorway as if he had beendazzled by the light Then he came into the room He walked with justsuch a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps We stared at him insilence expecting him to speakHe said not a word but came painfully to the table and made a motiontowards the wine The Editor filled a glass of champagne and pushed ittowards him He drained it and it seemed to do him good for he lookedround the table and the ghost of his old smile flickered across hisface What on earth have you been up to man said the Doctor TheTime Traveller did not seem to hear Dont let me disturb you hesaid with a certain faltering articulation Im all right Hestopped held out his glass for more and took it off at a draughtThats good he said His eyes grew brighter and a faint colour cameinto his cheeks His glance flickered over our faces with a certaindull approval and then went round the warm and comfortable room Thenhe spoke again still as it were feeling his way among his words Imgoing to wash and dress and then Ill come down and explain thingsSave me some of that mutton Im starving for a bit of meatHe looked across at the Editor who was a rare visitor and hoped hewas all right The Editor began a question Tell you presently saidthe Time Traveller Imfunny Be all right in a minuteHe put down his glass and walked towards the staircase door Again Iremarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall andstanding up in my place I saw his feet as he went out He had nothingon them but a pair of tattered bloodstained socks Then the doorclosed upon him I had half a mind to follow till I remembered how hedetested any fuss about himself For a minute perhaps my mind waswoolgathering Then Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist Iheard the Editor say thinking after his wont in headlines And thisbrought my attention back to the bright dinnertableWhats the game said the Journalist Has he been doing the AmateurCadger I dont follow I met the eye of the Psychologist and read myown interpretation in his face I thought of the Time Traveller limpingpainfully upstairs I dont think anyone else had noticed his lamenessThe first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Manwho rang the bellthe Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting atdinnerfor a hot plate At that the Editor turned to his knife and forkwith a grunt and the Silent Man followed suit The dinner was resumedConversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps ofwonderment and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity Does ourfriend eke out his modest income with a crossing or has he hisNebuchadnezzar phases he inquired I feel assured its this businessof the Time Machine I said and took up the Psychologists account ofour previous meeting The new guests were frankly incredulous TheEditor raised objections What _was_ this time travelling A mancouldnt cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox could heAnd then as the idea came home to him he resorted to caricatureHadnt they any clothesbrushes in the Future The Journalist toowould not believe at any price and joined the Editor in the easy workof heaping ridicule on the whole thing They were both the new kind ofjournalistvery joyous irreverent young men Our SpecialCorrespondent in the Day after Tomorrow reports the Journalist wassayingor rather shoutingwhen the Time Traveller came back He wasdressed in ordinary evening clothes and nothing save his haggard lookremained of the change that had startled meI say said the Editor hilariously these chaps here say you havebeen travelling into the middle of next week Tell us all about littleRosebery will you What will you take for the lotThe Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a wordHe smiled quietly in his old way Wheres my mutton he said Whata treat it is to stick a fork into meat againStory cried the EditorStory be damned said the Time Traveller I want something to eat Iwont say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries Thanks Andthe saltOne word said I Have you been time travellingYes said the Time Traveller with his mouth full nodding his headId give a shilling a line for a verbatim note said the Editor TheTime Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it withhis fingernail at which the Silent Man who had been staring at hisface started convulsively and poured him wine The rest of the dinnerwas uncomfortable For my own part sudden questions kept on rising tomy lips and I dare say it was the same with the others The Journalisttried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter TheTime Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner and displayed theappetite of a tramp The Medical Man smoked a cigarette and watchedthe Time Traveller through his eyelashes The Silent Man seemed evenmore clumsy than usual and drank champagne with regularity anddetermination out of sheer nervousness At last the Time Travellerpushed his plate away and looked round us I suppose I mustapologise he said I was simply starving Ive had a most amazingtime He reached out his hand for a cigar and cut the end But comeinto the smokingroom Its too long a story to tell over greasyplates And ringing the bell in passing he led the way into theadjoining roomYou have told Blank and Dash and Chose about the machine he saidto me leaning back in his easychair and naming the three new guestsBut the things a mere paradox said the EditorI cant argue tonight I dont mind telling you the story but I cantargue I will he went on tell you the story of what has happened tome if you like but you must refrain from interruptions I want totell it Badly Most of it will sound like lying So be it Itstrueevery word of it all the same I was in my laboratory at fouroclock and since then  Ive lived eight days  such days as no humanbeing ever lived before Im nearly worn out but I shant sleep tillIve told this thing over to you Then I shall go to bed But nointerruptions Is it agreedAgreed said the Editor and the rest of us echoed Agreed And withthat the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth He satback in his chair at first and spoke like a weary man Afterwards hegot more animated In writing it down I feel with only too muchkeenness the inadequacy of pen and inkand above all my owninadequacyto express its quality You read I will supposeattentively enough but you cannot see the speakers white sincereface in the bright circle of the little lamp nor hear the intonationof his voice You cannot know how his expression followed the turns ofhis story Most of us hearers were in shadow for the candles in thesmokingroom had not been lighted and only the face of the Journalistand the legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward wereilluminated At first we glanced now and again at each other After atime we ceased to do that and looked only at the Time Travellersface IV Time TravellingI told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the TimeMachine and showed you the actual thing itself incomplete in theworkshop There it is now a little travelworn truly and one of theivory bars is cracked and a brass rail bent but the rest of itssound enough I expected to finish it on Friday but on Friday whenthe putting together was nearly done I found that one of the nickelbars was exactly one inch too short and this I had to get remade sothat the thing was not complete until this morning It was at tenoclock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career Igave it a last tap tried all the screws again put one more drop ofoil on the quartz rod and sat myself in the saddle I suppose asuicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder atwhat will come next as I felt then I took the starting lever in onehand and the stopping one in the other pressed the first and almostimmediately the second I seemed to reel I felt a nightmare sensationof falling and looking round I saw the laboratory exactly as beforeHad anything happened For a moment I suspected that my intellect hadtricked me Then I noted the clock A moment before as it seemed ithad stood at a minute or so past ten now it was nearly halfpastthreeI drew a breath set my teeth gripped the starting lever with bothhands and went off with a thud The laboratory got hazy and went darkMrs Watchett came in and walked apparently without seeing me towardsthe garden door I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse theplace but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket Ipressed the lever over to its extreme position The night came like theturning out of a lamp and in another moment came tomorrow Thelaboratory grew faint and hazy then fainter and ever fainter Tomorrownight came black then day again night again day again faster andfaster still An eddying murmur filled my ears and a strange dumbconfusedness descended on my mindI am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of timetravelling They are excessively unpleasant There is a feeling exactlylike that one has upon a switchbackof a helpless headlong motion Ifelt the same horrible anticipation too of an imminent smash As Iput on pace night followed day like the flapping of a black wing Thedim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from meand I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky leaping it everyminute and every minute marking a day I supposed the laboratory hadbeen destroyed and I had come into the open air I had a dim impressionof scaffolding but I was already going too fast to be conscious of anymoving things The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fastfor me The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessivelypainful to the eye Then in the intermittent darknesses I saw themoon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full and had afaint glimpse of the circling stars Presently as I went on stillgaining velocity the palpitation of night and day merged into onecontinuous greyness the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue asplendid luminous colour like that of early twilight the jerking sunbecame a streak of fire a brilliant arch in space the moon a fainterfluctuating band and I could see nothing of the stars save now andthen a brighter circle flickering in the blueThe landscape was misty and vague I was still on the hillside uponwhich this house now stands and the shoulder rose above me grey anddim I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour now brownnow green they grew spread shivered and passed away I saw hugebuildings rise up faint and fair and pass like dreams The wholesurface of the earth seemed changedmelting and flowing under my eyesThe little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced roundfaster and faster Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up anddown from solstice to solstice in a minute or less and thatconsequently my pace was over a year a minute and minute by minute thewhite snow flashed across the world and vanished and was followed bythe bright brief green of springThe unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now Theymerged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration I remarkedindeed a clumsy swaying of the machine for which I was unable toaccount But my mind was too confused to attend to it so with a kindof madness growing upon me I flung myself into futurity At first Iscarce thought of stopping scarce thought of anything but these newsensations But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in myminda certain curiosity and therewith a certain dreaduntil at lastthey took complete possession of me What strange developments ofhumanity what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation Ithought might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dimelusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes I saw great andsplendid architecture rising about me more massive than any buildingsof our own time and yet as it seemed built of glimmer and mist Isaw a richer green flow up the hillside and remain there without anywintry intermission Even through the veil of my confusion the earthseemed very fair And so my mind came round to the business ofstoppingThe peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substancein the space which I or the machine occupied So long as I travelledat a high velocity through time this scarcely mattered I was so tospeak attenuatedwas slipping like a vapour through the interstices ofintervening substances But to come to a stop involved the jamming ofmyself molecule by molecule into whatever lay in my way meantbringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstaclethat a profound chemical reactionpossibly a farreachingexplosionwould result and blow myself and my apparatus out of allpossible dimensionsinto the Unknown This possibility had occurred tome again and again while I was making the machine but then I hadcheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable riskone of the risks a manhas got to take Now the risk was inevitable I no longer saw it in thesame cheerful light The fact is that insensibly the absolutestrangeness of everything the sickly jarring and swaying of themachine above all the feeling of prolonged falling had absolutelyupset my nerves I told myself that I could never stop and with a gustof petulance I resolved to stop forthwith Like an impatient fool Ilugged over the lever and incontinently the thing went reeling overand I was flung headlong through the airThere was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears I may have beenstunned for a moment A pitiless hail was hissing round me and I wassitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine Everything stillseemed grey but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears wasgone I looked round me I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in agarden surrounded by rhododendron bushes and I noticed that theirmauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beatingof the hailstones The rebounding dancing hail hung in a little cloudover the machine and drove along the ground like smoke In a moment Iwas wet to the skin Fine hospitality said I to a man who hastravelled innumerable years to see youPresently I thought what a fool I was to get wet I stood up andlooked round me A colossal figure carved apparently in some whitestone loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazydownpour But all else of the world was invisibleMy sensations would be hard to describe As the columns of hail grewthinner I saw the white figure more distinctly It was very large fora silver birchtree touched its shoulder It was of white marble inshape something like a winged sphinx but the wings instead of beingcarried vertically at the sides were spread so that it seemed tohover The pedestal it appeared to me was of bronze and was thickwith verdigris It chanced that the face was towards me the sightlesseyes seemed to watch me there was the faint shadow of a smile on thelips It was greatly weatherworn and that imparted an unpleasantsuggestion of disease I stood looking at it for a little spacehalf aminute perhaps or half an hour It seemed to advance and to recede asthe hail drove before it denser or thinner At last I tore my eyes fromit for a moment and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare andthat the sky was lightening with the promise of the sunI looked up again at the crouching white shape and the full temerityof my voyage came suddenly upon me What might appear when that hazycurtain was altogether withdrawn What might not have happened to menWhat if cruelty had grown into a common passion What if in thisinterval the race had lost its manliness and had developed intosomething inhuman unsympathetic and overwhelmingly powerful I mightseem some oldworld savage animal only the more dreadful anddisgusting for our common likenessa foul creature to be incontinentlyslainAlready I saw other vast shapeshuge buildings with intricate parapetsand tall columns with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon methrough the lessening storm I was seized with a panic fear I turnedfrantically to the Time Machine and strove hard to readjust it As Idid so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm The greydownpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of aghost Above me in the intense blue of the summer sky some faintbrown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness The great buildingsabout me stood out clear and distinct shining with the wet of thethunderstorm and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piledalong their courses I felt naked in a strange world I felt as perhapsa bird may feel in the clear air knowing the hawk wings above and willswoop My fear grew to frenzy I took a breathing space set my teethand again grappled fiercely wrist and knee with the machine It gaveunder my desperate onset and turned over It struck my chin violentlyOne hand on the saddle the other on the lever I stood panting heavilyin attitude to mount againBut with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered Ilooked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remotefuture In a circular opening high up in the wall of the nearer houseI saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes They had seen me andtheir faces were directed towards meThen I heard voices approaching me Coming through the bushes by theWhite Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running One of theseemerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which Istood with my machine He was a slight creatureperhaps four feethighclad in a purple tunic girdled at the waist with a leather beltSandals or buskinsI could not clearly distinguish whichwere on hisfeet his legs were bare to the knees and his head was bare Noticingthat I noticed for the first time how warm the air wasHe struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature butindescribably frail His flushed face reminded me of the more beautifulkind of consumptivethat hectic beauty of which we used to hear somuch At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence I took myhands from the machine V In the Golden AgeIn another moment we were standing face to face I and this fragilething out of futurity He came straight up to me and laughed into myeyes The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me atonce Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoketo them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongueThere were others coming and presently a little group of perhapseight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me One of themaddressed me It came into my head oddly enough that my voice was tooharsh and deep for them So I shook my head and pointing to my earsshook it again He came a step forward hesitated and then touched myhand Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back andshoulders They wanted to make sure I was real There was nothing inthis at all alarming Indeed there was something in these prettylittle people that inspired confidencea graceful gentleness a certainchildlike ease And besides they looked so frail that I could fancymyself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins But I madea sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feelingat the Time Machine Happily then when it was not too late I thoughtof a danger I had hitherto forgotten and reaching over the bars of themachine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion andput these in my pocket Then I turned again to see what I could do inthe way of communicationAnd then looking more nearly into their features I saw some furtherpeculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness Their hairwhich was uniformly curly came to a sharp end at the neck and cheekthere was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face and their earswere singularly minute The mouths were small with bright red ratherthin lips and the little chins ran to a point The eyes were large andmild andthis may seem egotism on my partI fancied even that therewas a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in themAs they made no effort to communicate with me but simply stood roundme smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other I began theconversation I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself Thenhesitating for a moment how to express Time I pointed to the sun Atonce a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and whitefollowed my gesture and then astonished me by imitating the sound ofthunderFor a moment I was staggered though the import of his gesture wasplain enough The question had come into my mind abruptly were thesecreatures fools You may hardly understand how it took me You see Ihad always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred andTwo Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge arteverything Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showedhim to be on the intellectual level of one of our fiveyearoldchildrenasked me in fact if I had come from the sun in athunderstorm It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon theirclothes their frail light limbs and fragile features A flow ofdisappointment rushed across my mind For a moment I felt that I hadbuilt the Time Machine in vainI nodded pointed to the sun and gave them such a vivid rendering ofa thunderclap as startled them They all withdrew a pace or so andbowed Then came one laughing towards me carrying a chain of beautifulflowers altogether new to me and put it about my neck The idea wasreceived with melodious applause and presently they were all runningto and fro for flowers and laughingly flinging them upon me until Iwas almost smothered with blossom You who have never seen the like canscarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years ofculture had created Then someone suggested that their plaything shouldbe exhibited in the nearest building and so I was led past the sphinxof white marble which had seemed to watch me all the while with asmile at my astonishment towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stoneAs I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of aprofoundly grave and intellectual posterity came with irresistiblemerriment to my mindThe building had a huge entry and was altogether of colossaldimensions I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd oflittle people and with the big open portals that yawned before meshadowy and mysterious My general impression of the world I saw overtheir heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers a longneglected and yet weedless garden I saw a number of tall spikes ofstrange white flowers measuring a foot perhaps across the spread ofthe waxen petals They grew scattered as if wild among the variegatedshrubs but as I say I did not examine them closely at this time TheTime Machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendronsThe arch of the doorway was richly carved but naturally I did notobserve the carving very narrowly though I fancied I saw suggestionsof old Phœnician decorations as I passed through and it struck me thatthey were very badly broken and weatherworn Several more brightlyclad people met me in the doorway and so we entered I dressed indingy nineteenthcentury garments looking grotesque enough garlandedwith flowers and surrounded by an eddying mass of brightsoftcoloured robes and shining white limbs in a melodious whirl oflaughter and laughing speechThe big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung withbrown The roof was in shadow and the windows partially glazed withcoloured glass and partially unglazed admitted a tempered light Thefloor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal notplates nor slabsblocks and it was so much worn as I judged by thegoing to and fro of past generations as to be deeply channelled alongthe more frequented ways Transverse to the length were innumerabletables made of slabs of polished stone raised perhaps a foot fromthe floor and upon these were heaps of fruits Some I recognised as akind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange but for the most part theywere strangeBetween the tables was scattered a great number of cushions Uponthese my conductors seated themselves signing for me to do likewiseWith a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit withtheir hands flinging peel and stalks and so forth into the roundopenings in the sides of the tables I was not loath to follow theirexample for I felt thirsty and hungry As I did so I surveyed the hallat my leisureAnd perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated lookThe stainedglass windows which displayed only a geometrical patternwere broken in many places and the curtains that hung across the lowerend were thick with dust And it caught my eye that the corner of themarble table near me was fractured Nevertheless the general effectwas extremely rich and picturesque There were perhaps a couple ofhundred people dining in the hall and most of them seated as near tome as they could come were watching me with interest their littleeyes shining over the fruit they were eating All were clad in the samesoft and yet strong silky materialFruit by the bye was all their diet These people of the remotefuture were strict vegetarians and while I was with them in spite ofsome carnal cravings I had to be frugivorous also Indeed I foundafterwards that horses cattle sheep dogs had followed theIchthyosaurus into extinction But the fruits were very delightfulone in particular that seemed to be in season all the time I wastherea floury thing in a threesided huskwas especially good and Imade it my staple At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruitsand by the strange flowers I saw but later I began to perceive theirimportHowever I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant futurenow So soon as my appetite was a little checked I determined to makea resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mineClearly that was the next thing to do The fruits seemed a convenientthing to begin upon and holding one of these up I began a series ofinterrogative sounds and gestures I had some considerable difficultyin conveying my meaning At first my efforts met with a stare ofsurprise or inextinguishable laughter but presently a fairhairedlittle creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name Theyhad to chatter and explain the business at great length to each otherand my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of theirlanguage caused an immense amount of genuine if uncivil amusementHowever I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children and persisted andpresently I had a score of noun substantives at least at my commandand then I got to demonstrative pronouns and even the verb to eatBut it was slow work and the little people soon tired and wanted toget away from my interrogations so I determined rather of necessityto let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclinedAnd very little doses I found they were before long for I never metpeople more indolent or more easily fatigued VI The Sunset of MankindA queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts and that wastheir lack of interest They would come to me with eager cries ofastonishment like children but like children they would soon stopexamining me and wander away after some other toy The dinner and myconversational beginnings ended I noted for the first time that almostall those who had surrounded me at first were gone It is odd too howspeedily I came to disregard these little people I went out throughthe portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger wassatisfied I was continually meeting more of these men of the futurewho would follow me a little distance chatter and laugh about me andhaving smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way leave me again to myown devicesThe calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the greathall and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun Atfirst things were very confusing Everything was so entirely differentfrom the world I had knowneven the flowers The big building I hadleft was situated on the slope of a broad river valley but the Thameshad shifted perhaps a mile from its present position I resolved tomount to the summit of a crest perhaps a mile and a half away fromwhich I could get a wider view of this our planet in the year EightHundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One AD For that I shouldexplain was the date the little dials of my machine recordedAs I walked I was watching for every impression that could possiblyhelp to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found theworldfor ruinous it was A little way up the hill for instance was agreat heap of granite bound together by masses of aluminium a vastlabyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps amidst which werethick heaps of very beautiful pagodalike plantsnettles possiblybutwonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves and incapable ofstinging It was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structureto what end built I could not determine It was here that I wasdestined at a later date to have a very strange experiencethe firstintimation of a still stranger discoverybut of that I will speak inits proper placeLooking round with a sudden thought from a terrace on which I restedfor a while I realised that there were no small houses to be seenApparently the single house and possibly even the household hadvanished Here and there among the greenery were palacelike buildingsbut the house and the cottage which form such characteristic featuresof our own English landscape had disappearedCommunism said I to myselfAnd on the heels of that came another thought I looked at thehalfdozen little figures that were following me Then in a flash Iperceived that all had the same form of costume the same soft hairlessvisage and the same girlish rotundity of limb It may seem strangeperhaps that I had not noticed this before But everything was sostrange Now I saw the fact plainly enough In costume and in all thedifferences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes fromeach other these people of the future were alike And the childrenseemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents I judgedthen that the children of that time were extremely precociousphysically at least and I found afterwards abundant verification of myopinionSeeing the ease and security in which these people were living I feltthat this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one wouldexpect for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman theinstitution of the family and the differentiation of occupations aremere militant necessities of an age of physical force Where populationis balanced and abundant much childbearing becomes an evil rather thana blessing to the State where violence comes but rarely and offspringare secure there is less necessityindeed there is no necessityfor anefficient family and the specialisation of the sexes with reference totheir childrens needs disappears We see some beginnings of this evenin our own time and in this future age it was complete This I mustremind you was my speculation at the time Later I was to appreciatehow far it fell short of the realityWhile I was musing upon these things my attention was attracted by apretty little structure like a well under a cupola I thought in atransitory way of the oddness of wells still existing and then resumedthe thread of my speculations There were no large buildings towardsthe top of the hill and as my walking powers were evidentlymiraculous I was presently left alone for the first time With astrange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crestThere I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognisecorroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered insoft moss the armrests cast and filed into the resemblance ofgriffins heads I sat down on it and I surveyed the broad view of ourold world under the sunset of that long day It was as sweet and fair aview as I have ever seen The sun had already gone below the horizonand the west was flaming gold touched with some horizontal bars ofpurple and crimson Below was the valley of the Thames in which theriver lay like a band of burnished steel I have already spoken of thegreat palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery some in ruinsand some still occupied Here and there rose a white or silvery figurein the waste garden of the earth here and there came the sharpvertical line of some cupola or obelisk There were no hedges no signsof proprietary rights no evidences of agriculture the whole earth hadbecome a gardenSo watching I began to put my interpretation upon the things I hadseen and as it shaped itself to me that evening my interpretation wassomething in this way Afterwards I found I had got only a halftruthor only a glimpse of one facet of the truthIt seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane Theruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind For the firsttime I began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort inwhich we are at present engaged And yet come to think it is alogical consequence enough Strength is the outcome of need securitysets a premium on feebleness The work of ameliorating the conditionsof lifethe true civilising process that makes life more and moresecurehad gone steadily on to a climax One triumph of a unitedhumanity over Nature had followed another Things that are now meredreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carriedforward And the harvest was what I sawAfter all the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still inthe rudimentary stage The science of our time has attacked but alittle department of the field of human disease but even so itspreads its operations very steadily and persistently Our agricultureand horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivateperhaps a score or so of wholesome plants leaving the greater numberto fight out a balance as they can We improve our favourite plants andanimalsand how few they aregradually by selective breeding now a newand better peach now a seedless grape now a sweeter and largerflower now a more convenient breed of cattle We improve themgradually because our ideals are vague and tentative and ourknowledge is very limited because Nature too is shy and slow in ourclumsy hands Some day all this will be better organised and stillbetter That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies Thewhole world will be intelligent educated and cooperating thingswill move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature In theend wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal andvegetable life to suit our human needsThis adjustment I say must have been done and done well doneindeed for all Time in the space of Time across which my machine hadleapt The air was free from gnats the earth from weeds or fungieverywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers brilliantbutterflies flew hither and thither The ideal of preventive medicinewas attained Diseases had been stamped out I saw no evidence of anycontagious diseases during all my stay And I shall have to tell youlater that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had beenprofoundly affected by these changesSocial triumphs too had been effected I saw mankind housed insplendid shelters gloriously clothed and as yet I had found themengaged in no toil There were no signs of struggle neither social noreconomical struggle The shop the advertisement traffic all thatcommerce which constitutes the body of our world was gone It wasnatural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of asocial paradise The difficulty of increasing population had been metI guessed and population had ceased to increaseBut with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to thechange What unless biological science is a mass of errors is thecause of human intelligence and vigour Hardship and freedomconditions under which the active strong and subtle survive and theweaker go to the wall conditions that put a premium upon the loyalalliance of capable men upon selfrestraint patience and decisionAnd the institution of the family and the emotions that arise thereinthe fierce jealousy the tenderness for offspring parentalselfdevotion all found their justification and support in theimminent dangers of the young _Now_ where are these imminent dangersThere is a sentiment arising and it will grow against connubialjealousy against fierce maternity against passion of all sortsunnecessary things now and things that make us uncomfortable savagesurvivals discords in a refined and pleasant lifeI thought of the physical slightness of the people their lack ofintelligence and those big abundant ruins and it strengthened mybelief in a perfect conquest of Nature For after the battle comesQuiet Humanity had been strong energetic and intelligent and hadused all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which itlived And now came the reaction of the altered conditionsUnder the new conditions of perfect comfort and security thatrestless energy that with us is strength would become weakness Evenin our own time certain tendencies and desires once necessary tosurvival are a constant source of failure Physical courage and thelove of battle for instance are no great helpmay even behindrancesto a civilised man And in a state of physical balance andsecurity power intellectual as well as physical would be out ofplace For countless years I judged there had been no danger of war orsolitary violence no danger from wild beasts no wasting disease torequire strength of constitution no need of toil For such a lifewhat we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong areindeed no longer weak Better equipped indeed they are for the strongwould be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet No doubtthe exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was the outcome of the lastsurgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settleddown into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it livedtheflourish of that triumph which began the last great peace This hasever been the fate of energy in security it takes to art and toeroticism and then come languor and decayEven this artistic impetus would at last die awayhad almost died inthe Time I saw To adorn themselves with flowers to dance to sing inthe sunlight so much was left of the artistic spirit and no moreEven that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity We arekept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity and it seemed to methat here was that hateful grindstone broken at lastAs I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this simpleexplanation I had mastered the problem of the worldmastered the wholesecret of these delicious people Possibly the checks they had devisedfor the increase of population had succeeded too well and theirnumbers had rather diminished than kept stationary That would accountfor the abandoned ruins Very simple was my explanation and plausibleenoughas most wrong theories are VII A Sudden ShockAs I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man the fullmoon yellow and gibbous came up out of an overflow of silver light inthe northeast The bright little figures ceased to move about below anoiseless owl flitted by and I shivered with the chill of the night Idetermined to descend and find where I could sleepI looked for the building I knew Then my eye travelled along to thefigure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze growingdistinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter I could see thesilver birch against it There was the tangle of rhododendron bushesblack in the pale light and there was the little lawn I looked at thelawn again A queer doubt chilled my complacency No said I stoutlyto myself that was not the lawnBut it _was_ the lawn For the white leprous face of the sphinx wastowards it Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came home tome But you cannot The Time Machine was goneAt once like a lash across the face came the possibility of losingmy own age of being left helpless in this strange new world The barethought of it was an actual physical sensation I could feel it grip meat the throat and stop my breathing In another moment I was in apassion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slopeOnce I fell headlong and cut my face I lost no time in stanching theblood but jumped up and ran on with a warm trickle down my cheek andchin All the time I ran I was saying to myself They have moved it alittle pushed it under the bushes out of the way Nevertheless I ranwith all my might All the time with the certainty that sometimescomes with excessive dread I knew that such assurance was folly knewinstinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach My breathcame with pain I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hillcrest to the little lawn two miles perhaps in ten minutes And I amnot a young man I cursed aloud as I ran at my confident folly inleaving the machine wasting good breath thereby I cried aloud andnone answered Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlitworldWhen I reached the lawn my worst fears were realised Not a trace ofthe thing was to be seen I felt faint and cold when I faced the emptyspace among the black tangle of bushes I ran round it furiously as ifthe thing might be hidden in a corner and then stopped abruptly withmy hands clutching my hair Above me towered the sphinx upon thebronze pedestal white shining leprous in the light of the risingmoon It seemed to smile in mockery of my dismayI might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had putthe mechanism in some shelter for me had I not felt assured of theirphysical and intellectual inadequacy That is what dismayed me thesense of some hitherto unsuspected power through whose intervention myinvention had vanished Yet for one thing I felt assured unless someother age had produced its exact duplicate the machine could not havemoved in time The attachment of the leversI will show you the methodlaterprevented anyone from tampering with it in that way when theywere removed It had moved and was hid only in space But then wherecould it beI think I must have had a kind of frenzy I remember running violentlyin and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx and startlingsome white animal that in the dim light I took for a small deer Iremember too late that night beating the bushes with my clenchedfist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigsThen sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind I went down to thegreat building of stone The big hall was dark silent and deserted Islipped on the uneven floor and fell over one of the malachite tablesalmost breaking my shin I lit a match and went on past the dustycurtains of which I have told youThere I found a second great hall covered with cushions upon whichperhaps a score or so of the little people were sleeping I have nodoubt they found my second appearance strange enough coming suddenlyout of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter andflare of a match For they had forgotten about matches Where is myTime Machine I began bawling like an angry child laying hands uponthem and shaking them up together It must have been very queer tothem Some laughed most of them looked sorely frightened When I sawthem standing round me it came into my head that I was doing asfoolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under thecircumstances in trying to revive the sensation of fear Forreasoning from their daylight behaviour I thought that fear must beforgottenAbruptly I dashed down the match and knocking one of the people overin my course went blundering across the big dininghall again outunder the moonlight I heard cries of terror and their little feetrunning and stumbling this way and that I do not remember all I did asthe moon crept up the sky I suppose it was the unexpected nature of myloss that maddened me I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kindastrange animal in an unknown world I must have raved to and froscreaming and crying upon God and Fate I have a memory of horriblefatigue as the long night of despair wore away of looking in thisimpossible place and that of groping among moonlit ruins and touchingstrange creatures in the black shadows at last of lying on the groundnear the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness even anger atthe folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength Ihad nothing left but misery Then I slept and when I woke again it wasfull day and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turfwithin reach of my armI sat up in the freshness of the morning trying to remember how I hadgot there and why I had such a profound sense of desertion anddespair Then things came clear in my mind With the plain reasonabledaylight I could look my circumstances fairly in the face I saw thewild folly of my frenzy overnight and I could reason with myselfSuppose the worst I said Suppose the machine altogetherlostperhaps destroyed It behoves me to be calm and patient to learnthe way of the people to get a clear idea of the method of my lossand the means of getting materials and tools so that in the endperhaps I may make another That would be my only hope a poor hopeperhaps but better than despair And after all it was a beautifuland curious worldBut probably the machine had only been taken away Still I must becalm and patient find its hidingplace and recover it by force orcunning And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about mewondering where I could bathe I felt weary stiff and travelsoiledThe freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness I hadexhausted my emotion Indeed as I went about my business I foundmyself wondering at my intense excitement overnight I made a carefulexamination of the ground about the little lawn I wasted some time infutile questionings conveyed as well as I was able to such of thelittle people as came by They all failed to understand my gesturessome were simply stolid some thought it was a jest and laughed at meI had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their prettylaughing faces It was a foolish impulse but the devil begotten offear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantageof my perplexity The turf gave better counsel I found a groove rippedin it about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks ofmy feet where on arrival I had struggled with the overturned machineThere were other signs of removal about with queer narrow footprintslike those I could imagine made by a sloth This directed my closerattention to the pedestal It was as I think I have said of bronzeIt was not a mere block but highly decorated with deep framed panelson either side I went and rapped at these The pedestal was hollowExamining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with theframes There were no handles or keyholes but possibly the panels ifthey were doors as I supposed opened from within One thing was clearenough to my mind It took no very great mental effort to infer that myTime Machine was inside that pedestal But how it got there was adifferent problemI saw the heads of two orangeclad people coming through the bushesand under some blossomcovered appletrees towards me I turned smilingto them and beckoned them to me They came and then pointing to thebronze pedestal I tried to intimate my wish to open it But at myfirst gesture towards this they behaved very oddly I dont know how toconvey their expression to you Suppose you were to use a grosslyimproper gesture to a delicateminded womanit is how she would lookThey went off as if they had received the last possible insult I trieda sweetlooking little chap in white next with exactly the sameresult Somehow his manner made me feel ashamed of myself But as youknow I wanted the Time Machine and I tried him once more As heturned off like the others my temper got the better of me In threestrides I was after him had him by the loose part of his robe roundthe neck and began dragging him towards the sphinx Then I saw thehorror and repugnance of his face and all of a sudden I let him goBut I was not beaten yet I banged with my fist at the bronze panelsI thought I heard something stir insideto be explicit I thought Iheard a sound like a chucklebut I must have been mistaken Then I gota big pebble from the river and came and hammered till I had flatteneda coil in the decorations and the verdigris came off in powderyflakes The delicate little people must have heard me hammering ingusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand but nothing came of it Isaw a crowd of them upon the slopes looking furtively at me At lasthot and tired I sat down to watch the place But I was too restless towatch long I am too Occidental for a long vigil I could work at aproblem for years but to wait inactive for twentyfour hoursthat isanother matterI got up after a time and began walking aimlessly through the bushestowards the hill again Patience said I to myself If you want yourmachine again you must leave that sphinx alone If they mean to takeyour machine away its little good your wrecking their bronze panelsand if they dont you will get it back as soon as you can ask for itTo sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that ishopeless That way lies monomania Face this world Learn its wayswatch it be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning In the endyou will find clues to it all Then suddenly the humour of thesituation came into my mind the thought of the years I had spent instudy and toil to get into the future age and now my passion ofanxiety to get out of it I had made myself the most complicated andthe most hopeless trap that ever a man devised Although it was at myown expense I could not help myself I laughed aloudGoing through the big palace it seemed to me that the little peopleavoided me It may have been my fancy or it may have had something todo with my hammering at the gates of bronze Yet I felt tolerably sureof the avoidance I was careful however to show no concern and toabstain from any pursuit of them and in the course of a day or twothings got back to the old footing I made what progress I could in thelanguage and in addition I pushed my explorations here and thereEither I missed some subtle point or their language was excessivelysimplealmost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbsThere seemed to be few if any abstract terms or little use offigurative language Their sentences were usually simple and of twowords and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplestpropositions I determined to put the thought of my Time Machine andthe mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx as much as possiblein a corner of memory until my growing knowledge would lead me back tothem in a natural way Yet a certain feeling you may understandtethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival VIII ExplanationSo far as I could see all the world displayed the same exuberantrichness as the Thames valley From every hill I climbed I saw the sameabundance of splendid buildings endlessly varied in material andstyle the same clustering thickets of evergreens the sameblossomladen trees and tree ferns Here and there water shone likesilver and beyond the land rose into blue undulating hills and sofaded into the serenity of the sky A peculiar feature which presentlyattracted my attention was the presence of certain circular wellsseveral as it seemed to me of a very great depth One lay by the pathup the hill which I had followed during my first walk Like the othersit was rimmed with bronze curiously wrought and protected by a littlecupola from the rain Sitting by the side of these wells and peeringdown into the shafted darkness I could see no gleam of water norcould I start any reflection with a lighted match But in all of them Iheard a certain sound a thudthudthud like the beating of some bigengine and I discovered from the flaring of my matches that a steadycurrent of air set down the shafts Further I threw a scrap of paperinto the throat of one and instead of fluttering slowly down it wasat once sucked swiftly out of sightAfter a time too I came to connect these wells with tall towersstanding here and there upon the slopes for above them there was oftenjust such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above asunscorched beach Putting things together I reached a strongsuggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation whosetrue import it was difficult to imagine I was at first inclined toassociate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people It was anobvious conclusion but it was absolutely wrongAnd here I must admit that I learnt very little of drains and bellsand modes of conveyance and the like conveniences during my time inthis real future In some of these visions of Utopias and coming timeswhich I have read there is a vast amount of detail about building andsocial arrangements and so forth But while such details are easyenough to obtain when the whole world is contained in onesimagination they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amidsuch realities as I found here Conceive the tale of London which anegro fresh from Central Africa would take back to his tribe Whatwould he know of railway companies of social movements of telephoneand telegraph wires of the Parcels Delivery Company and postal ordersand the like Yet we at least should be willing enough to explainthese things to him And even of what he knew how much could he makehis untravelled friend either apprehend or believe Then think hownarrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times andhow wide the interval between myself and these of the Golden Age I wassensible of much which was unseen and which contributed to my comfortbut save for a general impression of automatic organisation I fear Ican convey very little of the difference to your mindIn the matter of sepulture for instance I could see no signs ofcrematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs But it occurred to methat possibly there might be cemeteries or crematoria somewherebeyond the range of my explorings This again was a question Ideliberately put to myself and my curiosity was at first entirelydefeated upon the point The thing puzzled me and I was led to make afurther remark which puzzled me still more that aged and infirm amongthis people there were noneI must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of anautomatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure YetI could think of no other Let me put my difficulties The several bigpalaces I had explored were mere living places great dininghalls andsleeping apartments I could find no machinery no appliances of anykind Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must attimes need renewal and their sandals though undecorated were fairlycomplex specimens of metalwork Somehow such things must be made Andthe little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency Therewere no shops no workshops no sign of importations among them Theyspent all their time in playing gently in bathing in the river inmaking love in a halfplayful fashion in eating fruit and sleeping Icould not see how things were kept goingThen again about the Time Machine something I knew not what hadtaken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx _Why_ For thelife of me I could not imagine Those waterless wells too thoseflickering pillars I felt I lacked a clue I felthow shall I put itSuppose you found an inscription with sentences here and there inexcellent plain English and interpolated therewith others made up ofwords of letters even absolutely unknown to you Well on the thirdday of my visit that was how the world of Eight Hundred and TwoThousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to meThat day too I made a friendof a sort It happened that as I waswatching some of the little people bathing in a shallow one of themwas seized with cramp and began drifting downstream The main currentran rather swiftly but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmerIt will give you an idea therefore of the strange deficiency in thesecreatures when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt torescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before theireyes When I realised this I hurriedly slipped off my clothes andwading in at a point lower down I caught the poor mite and drew hersafe to land A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round andI had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her Ihad got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect anygratitude from her In that however I was wrongThis happened in the morning In the afternoon I met my little womanas I believe it was as I was returning towards my centre from anexploration and she received me with cries of delight and presented mewith a big garland of flowersevidently made for me and me alone Thething took my imagination Very possibly I had been feeling desolateAt any rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift Wewere soon seated together in a little stone arbour engaged inconversation chiefly of smiles The creatures friendliness affectedme exactly as a childs might have done We passed each other flowersand she kissed my hands I did the same to hers Then I tried talk andfound that her name was Weena which though I dont know what itmeant somehow seemed appropriate enough That was the beginning of aqueer friendship which lasted a week and endedas I will tell youShe was exactly like a child She wanted to be with me always Shetried to follow me everywhere and on my next journey out and about itwent to my heart to tire her down and leave her at last exhausted andcalling after me rather plaintively But the problems of the world hadto be mastered I had not I said to myself come into the future tocarry on a miniature flirtation Yet her distress when I left her wasvery great her expostulations at the parting were sometimes franticand I think altogether I had as much trouble as comfort from herdevotion Nevertheless she was somehow a very great comfort Ithought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me Untilit was too late I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon herwhen I left her Nor until it was too late did I clearly understandwhat she was to me For by merely seeming fond of me and showing inher weak futile way that she cared for me the little doll of acreature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the WhiteSphinx almost the feeling of coming home and I would watch for hertiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over the hillIt was from her too that I learnt that fear had not yet left theworld She was fearless enough in the daylight and she had the oddestconfidence in me for once in a foolish moment I made threateninggrimaces at her and she simply laughed at them But she dreaded thedark dreaded shadows dreaded black things Darkness to her was theone thing dreadful It was a singularly passionate emotion and it setme thinking and observing I discovered then among other things thatthese little people gathered into the great houses after dark andslept in droves To enter upon them without a light was to put theminto a tumult of apprehension I never found one out of doors or onesleeping alone within doors after dark Yet I was still such ablockhead that I missed the lesson of that fear and in spite ofWeenas distress I insisted upon sleeping away from these slumberingmultitudesIt troubled her greatly but in the end her odd affection for metriumphed and for five of the nights of our acquaintance includingthe last night of all she slept with her head pillowed on my arm Butmy story slips away from me as I speak of her It must have been thenight before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn I had beenrestless dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned and that seaanemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps I woke with astart and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushedout of the chamber I tried to get to sleep again but I felt restlessand uncomfortable It was that dim grey hour when things are justcreeping out of darkness when everything is colourless and clear cutand yet unreal I got up and went down into the great hall and so outupon the flagstones in front of the palace I thought I would make avirtue of necessity and see the sunriseThe moon was setting and the dying moonlight and the first pallor ofdawn were mingled in a ghastly halflight The bushes were inky blackthe ground a sombre grey the sky colourless and cheerless And up thehill I thought I could see ghosts Three several times as I scannedthe slope I saw white figures Twice I fancied I saw a solitary whiteapelike creature running rather quickly up the hill and once near theruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body They movedhastily I did not see what became of them It seemed that theyvanished among the bushes The dawn was still indistinct you mustunderstand I was feeling that chill uncertain earlymorning feelingyou may have known I doubted my eyesAs the eastern sky grew brighter and the light of the day came on andits vivid colouring returned upon the world once more I scanned theview keenly But I saw no vestige of my white figures They were merecreatures of the halflight They must have been ghosts I said Iwonder whence they dated For a queer notion of Grant Allens cameinto my head and amused me If each generation die and leave ghostshe argued the world at last will get overcrowded with them On thattheory they would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred ThousandYears hence and it was no great wonder to see four at once But thejest was unsatisfying and I was thinking of these figures all themorning until Weenas rescue drove them out of my head I associatedthem in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in myfirst passionate search for the Time Machine But Weena was a pleasantsubstitute Yet all the same they were soon destined to take fardeadlier possession of my mindI think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather ofthis Golden Age I cannot account for it It may be that the sun washotter or the earth nearer the sun It is usual to assume that the sunwill go on cooling steadily in the future But people unfamiliar withsuch speculations as those of the younger Darwin forget that theplanets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body Asthese catastrophes occur the sun will blaze with renewed energy andit may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate Whatever thereason the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we knowitWell one very hot morningmy fourth I thinkas I was seeking shelterfrom the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where Islept and fed there happened this strange thing Clambering amongthese heaps of masonry I found a narrow gallery whose end and sidewindows were blocked by fallen masses of stone By contrast with thebrilliancy outside it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me Ientered it groping for the change from light to blackness made spotsof colour swim before me Suddenly I halted spellbound A pair of eyesluminous by reflection against the daylight without was watching meout of the darknessThe old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me I clenched myhands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs I was afraid toturn Then the thought of the absolute security in which humanityappeared to be living came to my mind And then I remembered thatstrange terror of the dark Overcoming my fear to some extent Iadvanced a step and spoke I will admit that my voice was harsh andillcontrolled I put out my hand and touched something soft At oncethe eyes darted sideways and something white ran past me I turnedwith my heart in my mouth and saw a queer little apelike figure itshead held down in a peculiar manner running across the sunlit spacebehind me It blundered against a block of granite staggered asideand in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile ofruined masonryMy impression of it is of course imperfect but I know it was a dullwhite and had strange large greyishred eyes also that there wasflaxen hair on its head and down its back But as I say it went toofast for me to see distinctly I cannot even say whether it ran on allfours or only with its forearms held very low After an instantspause I followed it into the second heap of ruins I could not find itat first but after a time in the profound obscurity I came upon oneof those round welllike openings of which I have told you half closedby a fallen pillar A sudden thought came to me Could this Thing havevanished down the shaft I lit a match and looking down I saw asmall white moving creature with large bright eyes which regarded mesteadfastly as it retreated It made me shudder It was so like a humanspider It was clambering down the wall and now I saw for the firsttime a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladderdown the shaft Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of myhand going out as it dropped and when I had lit another the littlemonster had disappearedI do not know how long I sat peering down that well It was not forsome time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing Ihad seen was human But gradually the truth dawned on me that Manhad not remained one species but had differentiated into two distinctanimals that my graceful children of the Upper World were not the soledescendants of our generation but that this bleached obscenenocturnal Thing which had flashed before me was also heir to all theagesI thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an undergroundventilation I began to suspect their true import And what Iwondered was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balancedorganisation How was it related to the indolent serenity of thebeautiful Overworlders And what was hidden down there at the foot ofthat shaft I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that at anyrate there was nothing to fear and that there I must descend for thesolution of my difficulties And withal I was absolutely afraid to goAs I hesitated two of the beautiful upperworld people came running intheir amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow The male pursuedthe female flinging flowers at her as he ranThey seemed distressed to find me my arm against the overturnedpillar peering down the well Apparently it was considered bad form toremark these apertures for when I pointed to this one and tried toframe a question about it in their tongue they were still more visiblydistressed and turned away But they were interested by my matches andI struck some to amuse them I tried them again about the well andagain I failed So presently I left them meaning to go back to Weenaand see what I could get from her But my mind was already inrevolution my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to anew adjustment I had now a clue to the import of these wells to theventilating towers to the mystery of the ghosts to say nothing of ahint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the TimeMachine And very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solutionof the economic problem that had puzzled meHere was the new view Plainly this second species of Man wassubterranean There were three circumstances in particular which mademe think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of alongcontinued underground habit In the first place there was thebleached look common in most animals that live largely in the darkthewhite fish of the Kentucky caves for instance Then those large eyeswith that capacity for reflecting light are common features ofnocturnal thingswitness the owl and the cat And last of all thatevident confusion in the sunshine that hasty yet fumbling awkwardflight towards dark shadow and that peculiar carriage of the headwhile in the lightall reinforced the theory of an extremesensitiveness of the retinaBeneath my feet then the earth must be tunnelled enormously andthese tunnellings were the habitat of the New Race The presence ofventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopeseverywhere in factexcept along the river valleyshowed how universal were itsramifications What so natural then as to assume that it was in thisartificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort ofthe daylight race was done The notion was so plausible that I at onceaccepted it and went on to assume the _how_ of this splitting of thehuman species I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theorythough for myself I very soon felt that it fell far short of thetruthAt first proceeding from the problems of our own age it seemed clearas daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merelytemporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourerwas the key to the whole position No doubt it will seem grotesqueenough to youand wildly incredibleand yet even now there areexisting circumstances to point that way There is a tendency toutilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes ofcivilisation there is the Metropolitan Railway in London forinstance there are new electric railways there are subways there areunderground workrooms and restaurants and they increase and multiplyEvidently I thought this tendency had increased till Industry hadgradually lost its birthright in the sky I mean that it had gonedeeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factoriesspending a stillincreasing amount of its time therein till in theend Even now does not an Eastend worker live in such artificialconditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of theearthAgain the exclusive tendency of richer peopledue no doubt to theincreasing refinement of their education and the widening gulf betweenthem and the rude violence of the pooris already leading to theclosing in their interest of considerable portions of the surface ofthe land About London for instance perhaps half the prettier countryis shut in against intrusion And this same widening gulfwhich is dueto the length and expense of the higher educational process and theincreased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on thepart of the richwill make that exchange between class and class thatpromotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting ofour species along lines of social stratification less and lessfrequent So in the end above ground you must have the Havespursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty and below ground theHavenots the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions oftheir labour Once they were there they would no doubt have to payrent and not a little of it for the ventilation of their caverns andif they refused they would starve or be suffocated for arrears Suchof them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious woulddie and in the end the balance being permanent the survivors wouldbecome as well adapted to the conditions of underground life and ashappy in their way as the Overworld people were to theirs As itseemed to me the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followednaturally enoughThe great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shapein my mind It had been no such triumph of moral education and generalcooperation as I had imagined Instead I saw a real aristocracyarmed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion theindustrial system of today Its triumph had not been simply a triumphover Nature but a triumph over Nature and the fellowman This I mustwarn you was my theory at the time I had no convenient cicerone inthe pattern of the Utopian books My explanation may be absolutelywrong I still think it is the most plausible one But even on thissupposition the balanced civilisation that was at last attained musthave long since passed its zenith and was now far fallen into decayThe tooperfect security of the Overworlders had led them to a slowmovement of degeneration to a general dwindling in size strength andintelligence That I could see clearly enough already What hadhappened to the Undergrounders I did not yet suspect but from what Ihad seen of the Morlocksthat by the bye was the name by which thesecreatures were calledI could imagine that the modification of thehuman type was even far more profound than among the Eloi thebeautiful race that I already knewThen came troublesome doubts Why had the Morlocks taken my TimeMachine For I felt sure it was they who had taken it Why too if theEloi were masters could they not restore the machine to me And whywere they so terribly afraid of the dark I proceeded as I have saidto question Weena about this Underworld but here again I wasdisappointed At first she would not understand my questions andpresently she refused to answer them She shivered as though the topicwas unendurable And when I pressed her perhaps a little harshly sheburst into tears They were the only tears except my own I ever sawin that Golden Age When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble aboutthe Morlocks and was only concerned in banishing these signs of herhuman inheritance from Weenas eyes And very soon she was smiling andclapping her hands while I solemnly burnt a match IX The MorlocksIt may seem odd to you but it was two days before I could follow upthe newfound clue in what was manifestly the proper way I felt apeculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies They were just thehalfbleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved inspirit in a zoological museum And they were filthily cold to thetouch Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympatheticinfluence of the Eloi whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began toappreciateThe next night I did not sleep well Probably my health was a littledisordered I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt Once or twice Ihad a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definitereason I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where thelittle people were sleeping in the moonlightthat night Weena was amongthemand feeling reassured by their presence It occurred to me eventhen that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through itslast quarter and the nights grow dark when the appearances of theseunpleasant creatures from below these whitened Lemurs this new verminthat had replaced the old might be more abundant And on both thesedays I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty Ifelt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldlypenetrating these mysteries of underground Yet I could not face themystery If only I had had a companion it would have been differentBut I was so horribly alone and even to clamber down into the darknessof the well appalled me I dont know if you will understand myfeeling but I never felt quite safe at my backIt was this restlessness this insecurity perhaps that drove mefarther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions Going to thesouthwestward towards the rising country that is now called CombeWood I observed faroff in the direction of nineteenthcenturyBanstead a vast green structure different in character from any I hadhitherto seen It was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins Iknew and the façade had an Oriental look the face of it having thelustre as well as the palegreen tint a kind of bluishgreen of acertain type of Chinese porcelain This difference in aspect suggesteda difference in use and I was minded to push on and explore But theday was growing late and I had come upon the sight of the place aftera long and tiring circuit so I resolved to hold over the adventure forthe following day and I returned to the welcome and the caresses oflittle Weena But next morning I perceived clearly enough that mycuriosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece ofselfdeception to enable me to shirk by another day an experience Idreaded I resolved I would make the descent without further waste oftime and started out in the early morning towards a well near theruins of granite and aluminiumLittle Weena ran with me She danced beside me to the well but whenshe saw me lean over the mouth and look downward she seemed strangelydisconcerted Goodbye little Weena I said kissing her and thenputting her down I began to feel over the parapet for the climbinghooks Rather hastily I may as well confess for I feared my couragemight leak away At first she watched me in amazement Then she gave amost piteous cry and running to me she began to pull at me with herlittle hands I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed Ishook her off perhaps a little roughly and in another moment I was inthe throat of the well I saw her agonised face over the parapet andsmiled to reassure her Then I had to look down at the unstable hooksto which I clungI had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards Thedescent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from thesides of the well and these being adapted to the needs of a creaturemuch smaller and lighter than myself I was speedily cramped andfatigued by the descent And not simply fatigued One of the bars bentsuddenly under my weight and almost swung me off into the blacknessbeneath For a moment I hung by one hand and after that experience Idid not dare to rest again Though my arms and back were presentlyacutely painful I went on clambering down the sheer descent with asquick a motion as possible Glancing upward I saw the aperture asmall blue disc in which a star was visible while little Weenas headshowed as a round black projection The thudding sound of a machinebelow grew louder and more oppressive Everything save that little discabove was profoundly dark and when I looked up again Weena haddisappearedI was in an agony of discomfort I had some thought of trying to go upthe shaft again and leave the Underworld alone But even while Iturned this over in my mind I continued to descend At last withintense relief I saw dimly coming up a foot to the right of me aslender loophole in the wall Swinging myself in I found it was theaperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down andrest It was not too soon My arms ached my back was cramped and Iwas trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall Besides this theunbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes The airwas full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaftI do not know how long I lay I was arroused by a soft hand touchingmy face Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches andhastily striking one I saw three stooping white creatures similar tothe one I had seen above ground in the ruin hastily retreating beforethe light Living as they did in what appeared to me impenetrabledarkness their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive just as arethe pupils of the abysmal fishes and they reflected the light in thesame way I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurityand they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light Butso soon as I struck a match in order to see them they fledincontinently vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels from whichtheir eyes glared at me in the strangest fashionI tried to call to them but the language they had was apparentlydifferent from that of the Overworld people so that I was needs leftto my own unaided efforts and the thought of flight before explorationwas even then in my mind But I said to myself You are in for itnow and feeling my way along the tunnel I found the noise ofmachinery grow louder Presently the walls fell away from me and Icame to a large open space and striking another match saw that I hadentered a vast arched cavern which stretched into utter darknessbeyond the range of my light The view I had of it was as much as onecould see in the burning of a matchNecessarily my memory is vague Great shapes like big machines roseout of the dimness and cast grotesque black shadows in which dimspectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare The place by the bye wasvery stuffy and oppressive and the faint halitus of freshlyshed bloodwas in the air Some way down the central vista was a little table ofwhite metal laid with what seemed a meal The Morlocks at any ratewere carnivorous Even at the time I remember wondering what largeanimal could have survived to furnish the red joint I saw It was allvery indistinct the heavy smell the big unmeaning shapes the obscenefigures lurking in the shadows and only waiting for the darkness tocome at me again Then the match burnt down and stung my fingers andfell a wriggling red spot in the blacknessI have thought since how particularly illequipped I was for such anexperience When I had started with the Time Machine I had startedwith the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainlybe infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances I had comewithout arms without medicine without anything to smokeat times Imissed tobacco frightfullyeven without enough matches If only I hadthought of a Kodak I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworldin a second and examined it at leisure But as it was I stood therewith only the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed mewithhands feet and teeth these and four safetymatches that stillremained to meI was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the darkand it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered that mystore of matches had run low It had never occurred to me until thatmoment that there was any need to economise them and I had wastedalmost half the box in astonishing the Overworlders to whom fire was anovelty Now as I say I had four left and while I stood in the darka hand touched mine lank fingers came feeling over my face and I wassensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour I fancied I heard thebreathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me I feltthe box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged and other handsbehind me plucking at my clothing The sense of these unseen creaturesexamining me was indescribably unpleasant The sudden realisation of myignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me veryvividly in the darkness I shouted at them as loudly as I could Theystarted away and then I could feel them approaching me again Theyclutched at me more boldly whispering odd sounds to each other Ishivered violently and shouted againrather discordantly This timethey were not so seriously alarmed and they made a queer laughingnoise as they came back at me I will confess I was horriblyfrightened I determined to strike another match and escape under theprotection of its glare I did so and eking out the flicker with ascrap of paper from my pocket I made good my retreat to the narrowtunnel But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out andin the blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind amongleaves and pattering like the rain as they hurried after meIn a moment I was clutched by several hands and there was nomistaking that they were trying to haul me back I struck anotherlight and waved it in their dazzled faces You can scarce imagine hownauseatingly inhuman they lookedthose pale chinless faces and greatlidless pinkishgrey eyesas they stared in their blindness andbewilderment But I did not stay to look I promise you I retreatedagain and when my second match had ended I struck my third It hadalmost burnt through when I reached the opening into the shaft I laydown on the edge for the throb of the great pump below made me giddyThen I felt sideways for the projecting hooks and as I did so myfeet were grasped from behind and I was violently tugged backward Ilit my last match  and it incontinently went out But I had my hand onthe climbing bars now and kicking violently I disengaged myself fromthe clutches of the Morlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaftwhile they stayed peering and blinking up at me all but one littlewretch who followed me for some way and wellnigh secured my boot as atrophyThat climb seemed interminable to me With the last twenty or thirtyfeet of it a deadly nausea came upon me I had the greatest difficultyin keeping my hold The last few yards was a frightful struggle againstthis faintness Several times my head swam and I felt all thesensations of falling At last however I got over the wellmouthsomehow and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight Ifell upon my face Even the soil smelt sweet and clean Then I rememberWeena kissing my hands and ears and the voices of others among theEloi Then for a time I was insensible X When Night CameNow indeed I seemed in a worse case than before Hitherto exceptduring my nights anguish at the loss of the Time Machine I had felt asustaining hope of ultimate escape but that hope was staggered bythese new discoveries Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded bythe childish simplicity of the little people and by some unknownforces which I had only to understand to overcome but there was analtogether new element in the sickening quality of the Morlocksasomething inhuman and malign Instinctively I loathed them Before Ihad felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit my concern waswith the pit and how to get out of it Now I felt like a beast in atrap whose enemy would come upon him soonThe enemy I dreaded may surprise you It was the darkness of the newmoon Weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensibleremarks about the Dark Nights It was not now such a very difficultproblem to guess what the coming Dark Nights might mean The moon wason the wane each night there was a longer interval of darkness And Inow understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear ofthe little Upperworld people for the dark I wondered vaguely what foulvillainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon I feltpretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong The Upperworldpeople might once have been the favoured aristocracy and the Morlockstheir mechanical servants but that had long since passed away The twospecies that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding downtowards or had already arrived at an altogether new relationship TheEloi like the Carlovignan kings had decayed to a mere beautifulfutility They still possessed the earth on sufferance since theMorlocks subterranean for innumerable generations had come at last tofind the daylit surface intolerable And the Morlocks made theirgarments I inferred and maintained them in their habitual needsperhaps through the survival of an old habit of service They did it asa standing horse paws with his foot or as a man enjoys killing animalsin sport because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it onthe organism But clearly the old order was already in part reversedThe Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace Ages agothousands of generations ago man had thrust his brother man out of theease and the sunshine And now that brother was coming backchangedAlready the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew They werebecoming reacquainted with Fear And suddenly there came into my headthe memory of the meat I had seen in the Underworld It seemed odd howit floated into my mind not stirred up as it were by the current of mymeditations but coming in almost like a question from outside I triedto recall the form of it I had a vague sense of something familiarbut I could not tell what it was at the timeStill however helpless the little people in the presence of theirmysterious Fear I was differently constituted I came out of this ageof ours this ripe prime of the human race when Fear does not paralyseand mystery has lost its terrors I at least would defend myselfWithout further delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastnesswhere I might sleep With that refuge as a base I could face thisstrange world with some of that confidence I had lost in realising towhat creatures night by night I lay exposed I felt I could never sleepagain until my bed was secure from them I shuddered with horror tothink how they must already have examined meI wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames butfound nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible All thebuildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterousclimbers as the Morlocks to judge by their wells must be Then thetall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleamof its walls came back to my memory and in the evening taking Weenalike a child upon my shoulder I went up the hills towards thesouthwest The distance I had reckoned was seven or eight miles butit must have been nearer eighteen I had first seen the place on amoist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished In additionthe heel of one of my shoes was loose and a nail was working throughthe solethey were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoorsso that Iwas lame And it was already long past sunset when I came in sight ofthe palace silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the skyWeena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her but after awhile she desired me to let her down and ran along by the side of meoccasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in mypockets My pockets had always puzzled Weena but at the last she hadconcluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for floraldecoration At least she utilised them for that purpose And thatreminds me In changing my jacket I found_The Time Traveller paused put his hand into his pocket and silentlyplaced two withered flowers not unlike very large white mallows uponthe little table Then he resumed his narrative_As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over thehill crest towards Wimbledon Weena grew tired and wanted to return tothe house of grey stone But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of thePalace of Green Porcelain to her and contrived to make her understandthat we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear You know that greatpause that comes upon things before the dusk Even the breeze stops inthe trees To me there is always an air of expectation about thatevening stillness The sky was clear remote and empty save for a fewhorizontal bars far down in the sunset Well that night theexpectation took the colour of my fears In that darkling calm mysenses seemed preternaturally sharpened I fancied I could even feelthe hollowness of the ground beneath my feet could indeed almost seethrough it the Morlocks on their anthill going hither and thither andwaiting for the dark In my excitement I fancied that they wouldreceive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war And whyhad they taken my Time MachineSo we went on in the quiet and the twilight deepened into night Theclear blue of the distance faded and one star after another came outThe ground grew dim and the trees black Weenas fears and her fatiguegrew upon her I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressedher Then as the darkness grew deeper she put her arms round my neckand closing her eyes tightly pressed her face against my shoulder Sowe went down a long slope into a valley and there in the dimness Ialmost walked into a little river This I waded and went up theopposite side of the valley past a number of sleeping houses and by astatuea Faun or some such figure _minus_ the head Here too wereacacias So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks but it was yetearly in the night and the darker hours before the old moon rose werestill to comeFrom the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide andblack before me I hesitated at this I could see no end to it eitherto the right or the left Feeling tiredmy feet in particular werevery soreI carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted andsat down upon the turf I could no longer see the Palace of GreenPorcelain and I was in doubt of my direction I looked into thethickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide Under thatdense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars Evenwere there no other lurking dangera danger I did not care to let myimagination loose uponthere would still be all the roots to stumbleover and the treeboles to strike against I was very tired too afterthe excitements of the day so I decided that I would not face it butwould pass the night upon the open hillWeena I was glad to find was fast asleep I carefully wrapped her inmy jacket and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise Thehillside was quiet and deserted but from the black of the wood therecame now and then a stir of living things Above me shone the starsfor the night was very clear I felt a certain sense of friendlycomfort in their twinkling All the old constellations had gone fromthe sky however that slow movement which is imperceptible in ahundred human lifetimes had long since rearranged them in unfamiliargroupings But the Milky Way it seemed to me was still the sametattered streamer of stardust as of yore Southward as I judged itwas a very bright red star that was new to me it was even moresplendid than our own green Sirius And amid all these scintillatingpoints of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like theface of an old friendLooking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all thegravities of terrestrial life I thought of their unfathomabledistance and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of theunknown past into the unknown future I thought of the greatprecessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes Only fortytimes had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that Ihad traversed And during these few revolutions all the activity allthe traditions the complex organisations the nations languagesliteratures aspirations even the mere memory of Man as I knew himhad been swept out of existence Instead were these frail creatures whohad forgotten their high ancestry and the white Things of which I wentin terror Then I thought of the Great Fear that was between the twospecies and for the first time with a sudden shiver came the clearknowledge of what the meat I had seen might be Yet it was toohorrible I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me her face whiteand starlike under the stars and forthwith dismissed the thoughtThrough that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as Icould and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signsof the old constellations in the new confusion The sky kept veryclear except for a hazy cloud or so No doubt I dozed at times Thenas my vigil wore on came a faintness in the eastward sky like thereflection of some colourless fire and the old moon rose thin andpeaked and white And close behind and overtaking it and overflowingit the dawn came pale at first and then growing pink and warm NoMorlocks had approached us Indeed I had seen none upon the hill thatnight And in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me thatmy fear had been unreasonable I stood up and found my foot with theloose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel so I satdown again took off my shoes and flung them awayI awakened Weena and we went down into the wood now green andpleasant instead of black and forbidding We found some fruit wherewithto break our fast We soon met others of the dainty ones laughing anddancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature asthe night And then I thought once more of the meat that I had seen Ifelt assured now of what it was and from the bottom of my heart Ipitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity Clearlyat some time in the LongAgo of human decay the Morlocks food had runshort Possibly they had lived on rats and suchlike vermin Even nowman is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than hewasfar less than any monkey His prejudice against human flesh is nodeepseated instinct And so these inhuman sons of men I tried tolook at the thing in a scientific spirit After all they were lesshuman and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or fourthousand years ago And the intelligence that would have made thisstate of things a torment had gone Why should I trouble myself TheseEloi were mere fatted cattle which the antlike Morlocks preserved andpreyed uponprobably saw to the breeding of And there was Weenadancing at my sideThen I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming uponme by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness Manhad been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of hisfellowman had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse and in thefullness of time Necessity had come home to him I even tried aCarlylelike scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay But thisattitude of mind was impossible However great their intellectualdegradation the Eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claimmy sympathy and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation andtheir FearI had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursueMy first was to secure some safe place of refuge and to make myselfsuch arms of metal or stone as I could contrive That necessity wasimmediate In the next place I hoped to procure some means of fire sothat I should have the weapon of a torch at hand for nothing I knewwould be more efficient against these Morlocks Then I wanted toarrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under theWhite Sphinx I had in mind a battering ram I had a persuasion that ifI could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I shoulddiscover the Time Machine and escape I could not imagine the Morlockswere strong enough to move it far away Weena I had resolved to bringwith me to our own time And turning such schemes over in my mind Ipursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as ourdwelling XI The Palace of Green PorcelainI found the Palace of Green Porcelain when we approached it aboutnoon deserted and falling into ruin Only ragged vestiges of glassremained in its windows and great sheets of the green facing hadfallen away from the corroded metallic framework It lay very high upona turfy down and looking northeastward before I entered it I wassurprised to see a large estuary or even creek where I judgedWandsworth and Battersea must once have been I thought thenthough Inever followed up the thoughtof what might have happened or might behappening to the living things in the seaThe material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeedporcelain and along the face of it I saw an inscription in someunknown character I thought rather foolishly that Weena might helpme to interpret this but I only learnt that the bare idea of writinghad never entered her head She always seemed to me I fancy morehuman than she was perhaps because her affection was so humanWithin the big valves of the doorwhich were open and brokenwe foundinstead of the customary hall a long gallery lit by many side windowsAt the first glance I was reminded of a museum The tiled floor wasthick with dust and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects wasshrouded in the same grey covering Then I perceived standing strangeand gaunt in the centre of the hall what was clearly the lower part ofa huge skeleton I recognised by the oblique feet that it was someextinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium The skull andthe upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust and in one placewhere rainwater had dropped through a leak in the roof the thingitself had been worn away Further in the gallery was the huge skeletonbarrel of a Brontosaurus My museum hypothesis was confirmed Goingtowards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves andclearing away the thick dust I found the old familiar glass cases ofour own time But they must have been airtight to judge from the fairpreservation of some of their contentsClearly we stood among the ruins of some latterday South KensingtonHere apparently was the Palæontological Section and a very splendidarray of fossils it must have been though the inevitable process ofdecay that had been staved off for a time and had through theextinction of bacteria and fungi lost ninetynine hundredths of itsforce was nevertheless with extreme sureness if with extreme slownessat work again upon all its treasures Here and there I found traces ofthe little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces orthreaded in strings upon reeds And the cases had in some instancesbeen bodily removedby the Morlocks as I judged The place was verysilent The thick dust deadened our footsteps Weena who had beenrolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case presently cameas I stared about me and very quietly took my hand and stood besidemeAnd at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of anintellectual age that I gave no thought to the possibilities itpresented Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded alittle from my mindTo judge from the size of the place this Palace of Green Porcelainhad a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palæontology possiblyhistorical galleries it might be even a library To me at least inmy present circumstances these would be vastly more interesting thanthis spectacle of oldtime geology in decay Exploring I found anothershort gallery running transversely to the first This appeared to bedevoted to minerals and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mindrunning on gunpowder But I could find no saltpetre indeed nonitrates of any kind Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago Yet thesulphur hung in my mind and set up a train of thinking As for therest of the contents of that gallery though on the whole they were thebest preserved of all I saw I had little interest I am no specialistin mineralogy and I went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallelto the first hall I had entered Apparently this section had beendevoted to natural history but everything had long since passed out ofrecognition A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had oncebeen stuffed animals desiccated mummies in jars that had once heldspirit a brown dust of departed plants that was all I was sorry forthat because I should have been glad to trace the patientreadjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had beenattained Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions butsingularly illlit the floor of it running downward at a slight anglefrom the end at which I entered At intervals white globes hung fromthe ceilingmany of them cracked and smashedwhich suggested thatoriginally the place had been artificially lit Here I was more in myelement for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of bigmachines all greatly corroded and many broken down but some stillfairly complete You know I have a certain weakness for mechanism andI was inclined to linger among these the more so as for the most partthey had the interest of puzzles and I could make only the vaguestguesses at what they were for I fancied that if I could solve theirpuzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be ofuse against the MorlocksSuddenly Weena came very close to my side So suddenly that shestartled me Had it not been for her I do not think I should havenoticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all Footnote It maybe of course that the floor did not slope but that the museum wasbuilt into the side of a hillED The end I had come in at was quiteabove ground and was lit by rare slitlike windows As you went downthe length the ground came up against these windows until at lastthere was a pit like the area of a London house before each and onlya narrow line of daylight at the top I went slowly along puzzlingabout the machines and had been too intent upon them to notice thegradual diminution of the light until Weenas increasing apprehensionsdrew my attention Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into athick darkness I hesitated and then as I looked round me I saw thatthe dust was less abundant and its surface less even Further awaytowards the dimness it appeared to be broken by a number of smallnarrow footprints My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocksrevived at that I felt that I was wasting my time in the academicexamination of machinery I called to mind that it was already faradvanced in the afternoon and that I had still no weapon no refugeand no means of making a fire And then down in the remote blackness ofthe gallery I heard a peculiar pattering and the same odd noises I hadheard down the wellI took Weenas hand Then struck with a sudden idea I left her andturned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in asignalbox Clambering upon the stand and grasping this lever in myhands I put all my weight upon it sideways Suddenly Weena desertedin the central aisle began to whimper I had judged the strength ofthe lever pretty correctly for it snapped after a minutes strain andI rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient I judgedfor any Morlock skull I might encounter And I longed very much to killa Morlock or so Very inhuman you may think to want to go killingones own descendants But it was impossible somehow to feel anyhumanity in the things Only my disinclination to leave Weena and apersuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for murder my TimeMachine might suffer restrained me from going straight down thegallery and killing the brutes I heardWell mace in one hand and Weena in the other I went out of thatgallery and into another and still larger one which at the firstglance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags Thebrown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it I presentlyrecognised as the decaying vestiges of books They had long sincedropped to pieces and every semblance of print had left them But hereand there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told thetale well enough Had I been a literary man I might perhaps havemoralised upon the futility of all ambition But as it was the thingthat struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour towhich this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified At the time Iwill confess that I thought chiefly of the _Philosophical Transactions_and my own seventeen papers upon physical opticsThen going up a broad staircase we came to what may once have been agallery of technical chemistry And here I had not a little hope ofuseful discoveries Except at one end where the roof had collapsedthis gallery was well preserved I went eagerly to every unbroken caseAnd at last in one of the really airtight cases I found a box ofmatches Very eagerly I tried them They were perfectly good They werenot even damp I turned to Weena Dance I cried to her in her owntongue For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures wefeared And so in that derelict museum upon the thick soft carpetingof dust to Weenas huge delight I solemnly performed a kind ofcomposite dance whistling _The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as Icould In part it was a modest _cancan_ in part a step dance in parta skirt dance so far as my tailcoat permitted and in part originalFor I am naturally inventive as you knowNow I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped thewear of time for immemorial years was a most strange as for me it wasa most fortunate thing Yet oddly enough I found a far unlikeliersubstance and that was camphor I found it in a sealed jar that bychance I suppose had been really hermetically sealed I fancied atfirst that it was paraffin wax and smashed the glass accordingly Butthe odour of camphor was unmistakable In the universal decay thisvolatile substance had chanced to survive perhaps through manythousands of centuries It reminded me of a sepia painting I had onceseen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have perishedand become fossilised millions of years ago I was about to throw itaway but I remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a goodbright flamewas in fact an excellent candleand I put it in mypocket I found no explosives however nor any means of breaking downthe bronze doors As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing Ihad chanced upon Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elatedI cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon It wouldrequire a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at allthe proper order I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of armsand how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword Icould not carry both however and my bar of iron promised best againstthe bronze gates There were numbers of guns pistols and rifles Themost were masses of rust but many were of some new metal and stillfairly sound But any cartridges or powder there may once have been hadrotted into dust One corner I saw was charred and shattered perhapsI thought by an explosion among the specimens In another place was avast array of idolsPolynesian Mexican Grecian Phœnician everycountry on earth I should think And here yielding to an irresistibleimpulse I wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from SouthAmerica that particularly took my fancyAs the evening drew on my interest waned I went through galleryafter gallery dusty silent often ruinous the exhibits sometimesmere heaps of rust and lignite sometimes fresher In one place Isuddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine and then by themerest accident I discovered in an airtight case two dynamitecartridges I shouted Eureka and smashed the case with joy Thencame a doubt I hesitated Then selecting a little side gallery Imade my essay I never felt such a disappointment as I did in waitingfive ten fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came Of coursethe things were dummies as I might have guessed from their presence Ireally believe that had they not been so I should have rushed offincontinently and blown Sphinx bronze doors and as it proved mychances of finding the Time Machine all together into nonexistenceIt was after that I think that we came to a little open court withinthe palace It was turfed and had three fruittrees So we rested andrefreshed ourselves Towards sunset I began to consider our positionNight was creeping upon us and my inaccessible hidingplace had stillto be found But that troubled me very little now I had in mypossession a thing that was perhaps the best of all defences againstthe MorlocksI had matches I had the camphor in my pocket too if ablaze were needed It seemed to me that the best thing we could dowould be to pass the night in the open protected by a fire In themorning there was the getting of the Time Machine Towards that asyet I had only my iron mace But now with my growing knowledge Ifelt very differently towards those bronze doors Up to this I hadrefrained from forcing them largely because of the mystery on theother side They had never impressed me as being very strong and Ihoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work XII In the DarknessWe emerged from the Palace while the sun was still in part above thehorizon I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the nextmorning and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that hadstopped me on the previous journey My plan was to go as far aspossible that night and then building a fire to sleep in theprotection of its glare Accordingly as we went along I gathered anysticks or dried grass I saw and presently had my arms full of suchlitter Thus loaded our progress was slower than I had anticipatedand besides Weena was tired And I also began to suffer fromsleepiness too so that it was full night before we reached the woodUpon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped fearing thedarkness before us but a singular sense of impending calamity thatshould indeed have served me as a warning drove me onward I had beenwithout sleep for a night and two days and I was feverish andirritable I felt sleep coming upon me and the Morlocks with itWhile we hesitated among the black bushes behind us and dim againsttheir blackness I saw three crouching figures There was scrub andlong grass all about us and I did not feel safe from their insidiousapproach The forest I calculated was rather less than a mile acrossIf we could get through it to the bare hillside there as it seemed tome was an altogether safer restingplace I thought that with mymatches and my camphor I could contrive to keep my path illuminatedthrough the woods Yet it was evident that if I was to flourish matcheswith my hands I should have to abandon my firewood so ratherreluctantly I put it down And then it came into my head that I wouldamaze our friends behind by lighting it I was to discover theatrocious folly of this proceeding but it came to my mind as aningenious move for covering our retreatI dont know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must bein the absence of man and in a temperate climate The suns heat israrely strong enough to burn even when it is focused by dewdrops asis sometimes the case in more tropical districts Lightning may blastand blacken but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire Decayingvegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentationbut this rarely results in flame In this decadence too the art offiremaking had been forgotten on the earth The red tongues that wentlicking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing toWeenaShe wanted to run to it and play with it I believe she would havecast herself into it had I not restrained her But I caught her up andin spite of her struggles plunged boldly before me into the wood Fora little way the glare of my fire lit the path Looking back presentlyI could see through the crowded stems that from my heap of sticks theblaze had spread to some bushes adjacent and a curved line of fire wascreeping up the grass of the hill I laughed at that and turned againto the dark trees before me It was very black and Weena clung to meconvulsively but there was still as my eyes grew accustomed to thedarkness sufficient light for me to avoid the stems Overhead it wassimply black except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon ushere and there I lit none of my matches because I had no hand freeUpon my left arm I carried my little one in my right hand I had myiron barFor some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feetthe faint rustle of the breeze above and my own breathing and thethrob of the bloodvessels in my ears Then I seemed to know of apattering behind me I pushed on grimly The pattering grew moredistinct and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had heardin the Underworld There were evidently several of the Morlocks andthey were closing in upon me Indeed in another minute I felt a tug atmy coat then something at my arm And Weena shivered violently andbecame quite stillIt was time for a match But to get one I must put her down I did soand as I fumbled with my pocket a struggle began in the darknessabout my knees perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiarcooing sounds from the Morlocks Soft little hands too were creepingover my coat and back touching even my neck Then the match scratchedand fizzed I held it flaring and saw the white backs of the Morlocksin flight amid the trees I hastily took a lump of camphor from mypocket and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane ThenI looked at Weena She was lying clutching my feet and quitemotionless with her face to the ground With a sudden fright I stoopedto her She seemed scarcely to breathe I lit the block of camphor andflung it to the ground and as it split and flared up and drove backthe Morlocks and the shadows I knelt down and lifted her The woodbehind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great companyShe seemed to have fainted I put her carefully upon my shoulder androse to push on and then there came a horrible realisation Inmanœuvring with my matches and Weena I had turned myself about severaltimes and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction lay mypath For all I knew I might be facing back towards the Palace ofGreen Porcelain I found myself in a cold sweat I had to think rapidlywhat to do I determined to build a fire and encamp where we were Iput Weena still motionless down upon a turfy bole and very hastilyas my first lump of camphor waned I began collecting sticks andleaves Here and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks eyesshone like carbunclesThe camphor flickered and went out I lit a match and as I did sotwo white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily awayOne was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me and Ifelt his bones grind under the blow of my fist He gave a whoop ofdismay staggered a little way and fell down I lit another piece ofcamphor and went on gathering my bonfire Presently I noticed how drywas some of the foliage above me for since my arrival on the TimeMachine a matter of a week no rain had fallen So instead of castingabout among the trees for fallen twigs I began leaping up and draggingdown branches Very soon I had a choking smoky fire of green wood anddry sticks and could economise my camphor Then I turned to whereWeena lay beside my iron mace I tried what I could to revive her butshe lay like one dead I could not even satisfy myself whether or notshe breathedNow the smoke of the fire beat over towards me and it must have mademe heavy of a sudden Moreover the vapour of camphor was in the airMy fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so I felt veryweary after my exertion and sat down The wood too was full of aslumbrous murmur that I did not understand I seemed just to nod andopen my eyes But all was dark and the Morlocks had their hands uponme Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket forthe matchbox andit had gone Then they gripped and closed with meagain In a moment I knew what had happened I had slept and my firehad gone out and the bitterness of death came over my soul The forestseemed full of the smell of burning wood I was caught by the neck bythe hair by the arms and pulled down It was indescribably horriblein the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me I feltas if I was in a monstrous spiders web I was overpowered and wentdown I felt little teeth nipping at my neck I rolled over and as Idid so my hand came against my iron lever It gave me strength Istruggled up shaking the human rats from me and holding the barshort I thrust where I judged their faces might be I could feel thesucculent giving of flesh and bone under my blows and for a moment Iwas freeThe strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fightingcame upon me I knew that both I and Weena were lost but I determinedto make the Morlocks pay for their meat I stood with my back to atree swinging the iron bar before me The whole wood was full of thestir and cries of them A minute passed Their voices seemed to rise toa higher pitch of excitement and their movements grew faster Yet nonecame within reach I stood glaring at the blackness Then suddenly camehope What if the Morlocks were afraid And close on the heels of thatcame a strange thing The darkness seemed to grow luminous Very dimlyI began to see the Morlocks about methree battered at my feetand thenI recognised with incredulous surprise that the others were runningin an incessant stream as it seemed from behind me and away throughthe wood in front And their backs seemed no longer white but reddishAs I stood agape I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap ofstarlight between the branches and vanish And at that I understoodthe smell of burning wood the slumbrous murmur that was growing nowinto a gusty roar the red glow and the Morlocks flightStepping out from behind my tree and looking back I saw through theblack pillars of the nearer trees the flames of the burning forest Itwas my first fire coming after me With that I looked for Weena butshe was gone The hissing and crackling behind me the explosive thudas each fresh tree burst into flame left little time for reflectionMy iron bar still gripped I followed in the Morlocks path It was aclose race Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as Iran that I was outflanked and had to strike off to the left But atlast I emerged upon a small open space and as I did so a Morlock cameblundering towards me and past me and went on straight into the fireAnd now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing I think ofall that I beheld in that future age This whole space was as bright asday with the reflection of the fire In the centre was a hillock ortumulus surmounted by a scorched hawthorn Beyond this was another armof the burning forest with yellow tongues already writhing from itcompletely encircling the space with a fence of fire Upon the hillsidewere some thirty or forty Morlocks dazzled by the light and heat andblundering hither and thither against each other in their bewildermentAt first I did not realise their blindness and struck furiously atthem with my bar in a frenzy of fear as they approached me killingone and crippling several more But when I had watched the gestures ofone of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky and heardtheir moans I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery inthe glare and I struck no more of themYet every now and then one would come straight towards me settingloose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him At one timethe flames died down somewhat and I feared the foul creatures wouldpresently be able to see me I was thinking of beginning the fight bykilling some of them before this should happen but the fire burst outagain brightly and I stayed my hand I walked about the hill amongthem and avoided them looking for some trace of Weena But Weena wasgoneAt last I sat down on the summit of the hillock and watched thisstrange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro andmaking uncanny noises to each other as the glare of the fire beat onthem The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky and throughthe rare tatters of that red canopy remote as though they belonged toanother universe shone the little stars Two or three Morlocks cameblundering into me and I drove them off with blows of my fiststrembling as I did soFor the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare Ibit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake I beat theground with my hands and got up and sat down again and wandered hereand there and again sat down Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes andcalling upon God to let me awake Thrice I saw Morlocks put their headsdown in a kind of agony and rush into the flames But at last abovethe subsiding red of the fire above the streaming masses of blacksmoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps and the diminishingnumbers of these dim creatures came the white light of the dayI searched again for traces of Weena but there were none It wasplain that they had left her poor little body in the forest I cannotdescribe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fateto which it seemed destined As I thought of that I was almost movedto begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me but Icontained myself The hillock as I have said was a kind of island inthe forest From its summit I could now make out through a haze ofsmoke the Palace of Green Porcelain and from that I could get mybearings for the White Sphinx And so leaving the remnant of thesedamned souls still going hither and thither and moaning as the daygrew clearer I tied some grass about my feet and limped on acrosssmoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally withfire towards the hidingplace of the Time Machine I walked slowlyfor I was almost exhausted as well as lame and I felt the intensestwretchedness for the horrible death of little Weena It seemed anoverwhelming calamity Now in this old familiar room it is more likethe sorrow of a dream than an actual loss But that morning it left meabsolutely lonely againterribly alone I began to think of this houseof mine of this fireside of some of you and with such thoughts camea longing that was painBut as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning skyI made a discovery In my trouser pocket were still some loose matchesThe box must have leaked before it was lost XIII The Trap of the White SphinxAbout eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of yellowmetal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrivalI thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could notrefrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence Here was the samebeautiful scene the same abundant foliage the same splendid palacesand magnificent ruins the same silver river running between itsfertile banks The gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither andthither among the trees Some were bathing in exactly the place where Ihad saved Weena and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain Andlike blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to theUnderworld I understood now what all the beauty of the Overworldpeople covered Very pleasant was their day as pleasant as the day ofthe cattle in the field Like the cattle they knew of no enemies andprovided against no needs And their end was the sameI grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect hadbeen It had committed suicide It had set itself steadfastly towardscomfort and ease a balanced society with security and permanency asits watchword it had attained its hopesto come to this at last Oncelife and property must have reached almost absolute safety The richhad been assured of his wealth and comfort the toiler assured of hislife and work No doubt in that perfect world there had been nounemployed problem no social question left unsolved And a great quiethad followedIt is a law of nature we overlook that intellectual versatility isthe compensation for change danger and trouble An animal perfectlyin harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism Nature neverappeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless There isno intelligence where there is no change and no need of change Onlythose animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge varietyof needs and dangersSo as I see it the Upperworld man had drifted towards his feebleprettiness and the Underworld to mere mechanical industry But thatperfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanicalperfectionabsolute permanency Apparently as time went on the feedingof an Underworld however it was effected had become disjointedMother Necessity who had been staved off for a few thousand yearscame back again and she began below The Underworld being in contactwith machinery which however perfect still needs some little thoughtoutside habit had probably retained perforce rather more initiativeif less of every other human character than the Upper And when othermeat failed them they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbiddenSo I say I saw it in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and TwoThousand Seven Hundred and One It may be as wrong an explanation asmortal wit could invent It is how the thing shaped itself to me andas that I give it to youAfter the fatigues excitements and terrors of the past days and inspite of my grief this seat and the tranquil view and the warmsunlight were very pleasant I was very tired and sleepy and soon mytheorising passed into dozing Catching myself at that I took my ownhint and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long andrefreshing sleepI awoke a little before sunsetting I now felt safe against beingcaught napping by the Morlocks and stretching myself I came on downthe hill towards the White Sphinx I had my crowbar in one hand andthe other hand played with the matches in my pocketAnd now came a most unexpected thing As I approached the pedestal ofthe sphinx I found the bronze valves were open They had slid down intogroovesAt that I stopped short before them hesitating to enterWithin was a small apartment and on a raised place in the corner ofthis was the Time Machine I had the small levers in my pocket Sohere after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the WhiteSphinx was a meek surrender I threw my iron bar away almost sorrynot to use itA sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portalFor once at least I grasped the mental operations of the MorlocksSuppressing a strong inclination to laugh I stepped through the bronzeframe and up to the Time Machine I was surprised to find it had beencarefully oiled and cleaned I have suspected since that the Morlockshad even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way tograsp its purposeNow as I stood and examined it finding a pleasure in the mere touchof the contrivance the thing I had expected happened The bronzepanels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang I was in thedarktrapped So the Morlocks thought At that I chuckled gleefullyI could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards meVery calmly I tried to strike the match I had only to fix on thelevers and depart then like a ghost But I had overlooked one littlething The matches were of that abominable kind that light only on theboxYou may imagine how all my calm vanished The little brutes were closeupon me One touched me I made a sweeping blow in the dark at themwith the levers and began to scramble into the saddle of the machineThen came one hand upon me and then another Then I had simply to fightagainst their persistent fingers for my levers and at the same timefeel for the studs over which these fitted One indeed they almostgot away from me As it slipped from my hand I had to butt in the darkwith my headI could hear the Morlocks skull ringto recover it Itwas a nearer thing than the fight in the forest I think this lastscrambleBut at last the lever was fixed and pulled over The clinging handsslipped from me The darkness presently fell from my eyes I foundmyself in the same grey light and tumult I have already described XIV The Further VisionI have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes withtime travelling And this time I was not seated properly in the saddlebut sideways and in an unstable fashion For an indefinite time I clungto the machine as it swayed and vibrated quite unheeding how I wentand when I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed tofind where I had arrived One dial records days and another thousandsof days another millions of days and another thousands of millionsNow instead of reversing the levers I had pulled them over so as togo forward with them and when I came to look at these indicators Ifound that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the secondshand of a watchinto futurityAs I drove on a peculiar change crept over the appearance of thingsThe palpitating greyness grew darker thenthough I was stilltravelling with prodigious velocitythe blinking succession of day andnight which was usually indicative of a slower pace returned andgrew more and more marked This puzzled me very much at first Thealternations of night and day grew slower and slower and so did thepassage of the sun across the sky until they seemed to stretch throughcenturies At last a steady twilight brooded over the earth a twilightonly broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling skyThe band of light that had indicated the sun had long sincedisappeared for the sun had ceased to setit simply rose and fell inthe west and grew ever broader and more red All trace of the moon hadvanished The circling of the stars growing slower and slower hadgiven place to creeping points of light At last some time before Istopped the sun red and very large halted motionless upon thehorizon a vast dome glowing with a dull heat and now and thensuffering a momentary extinction At one time it had for a little whileglowed more brilliantly again but it speedily reverted to its sullenred heat I perceived by this slowing down of its rising and settingthat the work of the tidal drag was done The earth had come to restwith one face to the sun even as in our own time the moon faces theearth Very cautiously for I remembered my former headlong fall Ibegan to reverse my motion Slower and slower went the circling handsuntil the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was nolonger a mere mist upon its scale Still slower until the dim outlinesof a desolate beach grew visibleI stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine looking roundThe sky was no longer blue Northeastward it was inky black and outof the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white starsOverhead it was a deep Indian red and starless and southeastward itgrew brighter to a glowing scarlet where cut by the horizon lay thehuge hull of the sun red and motionless The rocks about me were of aharsh reddish colour and all the trace of life that I could see atfirst was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projectingpoint on their southeastern face It was the same rich green that onesees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves plants which like thesegrow in a perpetual twilightThe machine was standing on a sloping beach The sea stretched away tothe southwest to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wansky There were no breakers and no waves for not a breath of wind wasstirring Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentlebreathing and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and livingAnd along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thickincrustation of saltpink under the lurid sky There was a sense ofoppression in my head and I noticed that I was breathing very fastThe sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering andfrom that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is nowFar away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream and saw a thinglike a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the skyand circling disappear over some low hillocks beyond The sound ofits voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmlyupon the machine Looking round me again I saw that quite near whatI had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards meThen I saw the thing was really a monstrous crablike creature Can youimagine a crab as large as yonder table with its many legs movingslowly and uncertainly its big claws swaying its long antennæ likecarters whips waving and feeling and its stalked eyes gleaming atyou on either side of its metallic front Its back was corrugated andornamented with ungainly bosses and a greenish incrustation blotchedit here and there I could see the many palps of its complicated mouthflickering and feeling as it movedAs I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me I felt atickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there I tried tobrush it away with my hand but in a moment it returned and almostimmediately came another by my ear I struck at this and caughtsomething threadlike It was drawn swiftly out of my hand With afrightful qualm I turned and I saw that I had grasped the antenna ofanother monster crab that stood just behind me Its evil eyes werewriggling on their stalks its mouth was all alive with appetite andits vast ungainly claws smeared with an algal slime were descendingupon me In a moment my hand was on the lever and I had placed a monthbetween myself and these monsters But I was still on the same beachand I saw them distinctly now as soon as I stopped Dozens of themseemed to be crawling here and there in the sombre light among thefoliated sheets of intense greenI cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over theworld The red eastern sky the northward blackness the salt Dead Seathe stony beach crawling with these foul slowstirring monsters theuniform poisonouslooking green of the lichenous plants the thin airthat hurts ones lungs all contributed to an appalling effect I movedon a hundred years and there was the same red suna little larger alittle dullerthe same dying sea the same chill air and the samecrowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed andthe red rocks And in the westward sky I saw a curved pale line like avast new moonSo I travelled stopping ever and again in great strides of athousand years or more drawn on by the mystery of the earths fatewatching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller inthe westward sky and the life of the old earth ebb away At last morethan thirty million years hence the huge redhot dome of the sun hadcome to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens Then Istopped once more for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappearedand the red beach save for its livid green liverworts and lichensseemed lifeless And now it was flecked with white A bitter coldassailed me Rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down To thenortheastward the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sablesky and I could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish whiteThere were fringes of ice along the sea margin with drifting massesfarther out but the main expanse of that salt ocean all bloody underthe eternal sunset was still unfrozenI looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained Acertain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of themachine But I saw nothing moving in earth or sky or sea The greenslime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct A shallowsandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from thebeach I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bankbut it became motionless as I looked at it and I judged that my eyehad been deceived and that the black object was merely a rock Thestars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle verylittleSuddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun hadchanged that a concavity a bay had appeared in the curve I saw thisgrow larger For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blacknessthat was creeping over the day and then I realised that an eclipse wasbeginning Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across thesuns disk Naturally at first I took it to be the moon but there ismuch to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit ofan inner planet passing very near to the earthThe darkness grew apace a cold wind began to blow in freshening gustsfrom the east and the showering white flakes in the air increased innumber From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper Beyondthese lifeless sounds the world was silent Silent It would be hard toconvey the stillness of it All the sounds of man the bleating ofsheep the cries of birds the hum of insects the stir that makes thebackground of our livesall that was over As the darkness thickenedthe eddying flakes grew more abundant dancing before my eyes and thecold of the air more intense At last one by one swiftly one afterthe other the white peaks of the distant hills vanished intoblackness The breeze rose to a moaning wind I saw the black centralshadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me In another moment the palestars alone were visible All else was rayless obscurity The sky wasabsolutely blackA horror of this great darkness came on me The cold that smote to mymarrow and the pain I felt in breathing overcame me I shivered anda deadly nausea seized me Then like a redhot bow in the sky appearedthe edge of the sun I got off the machine to recover myself I feltgiddy and incapable of facing the return journey As I stood sick andconfused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoalthere was nomistake now that it was a moving thingagainst the red water of thesea It was a round thing the size of a football perhaps or it maybe bigger and tentacles trailed down from it it seemed black againstthe weltering bloodred water and it was hopping fitfully about ThenI felt I was fainting But a terrible dread of lying helpless in thatremote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon thesaddle XV The Time Travellers ReturnSo I came back For a long time I must have been insensible upon themachine The blinking succession of the days and nights was resumedthe sun got golden again the sky blue I breathed with greaterfreedom The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed Thehands spun backward upon the dials At last I saw again the dim shadowsof houses the evidences of decadent humanity These too changed andpassed and others came Presently when the million dial was at zeroI slackened speed I began to recognise our own pretty and familiararchitecture the thousands hand ran back to the startingpoint thenight and day flapped slower and slower Then the old walls of thelaboratory came round me Very gently now I slowed the mechanismdownI saw one little thing that seemed odd to me I think I have told youthat when I set out before my velocity became very high Mrs Watchetthad walked across the room travelling as it seemed to me like arocket As I returned I passed again across that minute when shetraversed the laboratory But now her every motion appeared to be theexact inversion of her previous ones The door at the lower end openedand she glided quietly up the laboratory back foremost anddisappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered Justbefore that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment but he passed like aflashThen I stopped the machine and saw about me again the old familiarlaboratory my tools my appliances just as I had left them I got offthe thing very shakily and sat down upon my bench For several minutesI trembled violently Then I became calmer Around me was my oldworkshop again exactly as it had been I might have slept there andthe whole thing have been a dreamAnd yet not exactly The thing had started from the southeast cornerof the laboratory It had come to rest again in the northwest againstthe wall where you saw it That gives you the exact distance from mylittle lawn to the pedestal of the White Sphinx into which theMorlocks had carried my machineFor a time my brain went stagnant Presently I got up and came throughthe passage here limping because my heel was still painful andfeeling sorely begrimed I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_ on the table bythe door I found the date was indeed today and looking at thetimepiece saw the hour was almost eight oclock I heard your voicesand the clatter of plates I hesitatedI felt so sick and weak Then Isniffed good wholesome meat and opened the door on you You know therest I washed and dined and now I am telling you the story XVI After the StoryI know he said after a pause that all this will be absolutelyincredible to you but to me the one incredible thing is that I am heretonight in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces andtelling you these strange adventures He looked at the Medical ManNo I cannot expect you to believe it Take it as a lieor a prophecySay I dreamed it in the workshop Consider I have been speculating uponthe destinies of our race until I have hatched this fiction Treat myassertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interestAnd taking it as a story what do you think of itHe took up his pipe and began in his old accustomed manner to tapwith it nervously upon the bars of the grate There was a momentarystillness Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon thecarpet I took my eyes off the Time Travellers face and looked roundat his audience They were in the dark and little spots of colour swambefore them The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the contemplation ofour host The Editor was looking hard at the end of his cigarthesixth The Journalist fumbled for his watch The others as far as Iremember were motionlessThe Editor stood up with a sigh What a pity it is youre not a writerof stories he said putting his hand on the Time TravellersshoulderYou dont believe itWellI thought notThe Time Traveller turned to us Where are the matches he said Helit one and spoke over his pipe puffing To tell you the truth Ihardly believe it myself And yetHis eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers uponthe little table Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe and Isaw he was looking at some halfhealed scars on his knucklesThe Medical Man rose came to the lamp and examined the flowers Thegynæceums odd he said The Psychologist leant forward to seeholding out his hand for a specimenIm hanged if it isnt a quarter to one said the Journalist Howshall we get homePlenty of cabs at the station said the PsychologistIts a curious thing said the Medical Man but I certainly dontknow the natural order of these flowers May I have themThe Time Traveller hesitated Then suddenly Certainly notWhere did you really get them said the Medical ManThe Time Traveller put his hand to his head He spoke like one who wastrying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him They were put into mypocket by Weena when I travelled into Time He stared round the roomIm damned if it isnt all going This room and you and the atmosphereof every day is too much for my memory Did I ever make a Time Machineor a model of a Time Machine Or is it all only a dream They say lifeis a dream a precious poor dream at timesbut I cant stand anotherthat wont fit Its madness And where did the dream come from  Imust look at that machine If there is oneHe caught up the lamp swiftly and carried it flaring red through thedoor into the corridor We followed him There in the flickering lightof the lamp was the machine sure enough squat ugly and askew athing of brass ebony ivory and translucent glimmering quartz Solidto the touchfor I put out my hand and felt the rail of itand withbrown spots and smears upon the ivory and bits of grass and moss uponthe lower parts and one rail bent awryThe Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench and ran his handalong the damaged rail Its all right now he said The story Itold you was true Im sorry to have brought you out here in the coldHe took up the lamp and in an absolute silence we returned to thesmokingroomHe came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coatThe Medical Man looked into his face and with a certain hesitationtold him he was suffering from overwork at which he laughed hugely Iremember him standing in the open doorway bawling goodnightI shared a cab with the Editor He thought the tale a gaudy lie Formy own part I was unable to come to a conclusion The story was sofantastic and incredible the telling so credible and sober I layawake most of the night thinking about it I determined to go next dayand see the Time Traveller again I was told he was in the laboratoryand being on easy terms in the house I went up to him The laboratoryhowever was empty I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and putout my hand and touched the lever At that the squatsubstantiallooking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind Itsinstability startled me extremely and I had a queer reminiscence ofthe childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle I came backthrough the corridor The Time Traveller met me in the smokingroom Hewas coming from the house He had a small camera under one arm and aknapsack under the other He laughed when he saw me and gave me anelbow to shake Im frightfully busy said he with that thing inthereBut is it not some hoax I said Do you really travel through timeReally and truly I do And he looked frankly into my eyes Hehesitated His eye wandered about the room I only want half an hourhe said I know why you came and its awfully good of you Theressome magazines here If youll stop to lunch Ill prove you this timetravelling up to the hilt specimens and all If youll forgive myleaving you nowI consented hardly comprehending then the full import of his wordsand he nodded and went on down the corridor I heard the door of thelaboratory slam seated myself in a chair and took up a daily paperWhat was he going to do before lunchtime Then suddenly I was remindedby an advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson thepublisher at two I looked at my watch and saw that I could barelysave that engagement I got up and went down the passage to tell theTime TravellerAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation oddlytruncated at the end and a click and a thud A gust of air whirledround me as I opened the door and from within came the sound of brokenglass falling on the floor The Time Traveller was not there I seemedto see a ghostly indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of blackand brass for a momenta figure so transparent that the bench behindwith its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct but this phantasmvanished as I rubbed my eyes The Time Machine had gone Save for asubsiding stir of dust the further end of the laboratory was empty Apane of the skylight had apparently just been blown inI felt an unreasonable amazement I knew that something strange hadhappened and for the moment could not distinguish what the strangething might be As I stood staring the door into the garden openedand the manservant appearedWe looked at each other Then ideas began to come Has Mr  gone outthat way said INo sir No one has come out this way I was expecting to find himhereAt that I understood At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayedon waiting for the Time Traveller waiting for the second perhapsstill stranger story and the specimens and photographs he would bringwith him But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetimeThe Time Traveller vanished three years ago And as everybody knowsnow he has never returned EpilogueOne cannot choose but wonder Will he ever return It may be that heswept back into the past and fell among the blooddrinking hairysavages of the Age of Unpolished Stone into the abysses of theCretaceous Sea or among the grotesque saurians the huge reptilianbrutes of the Jurassic times He may even nowif I may use thephrasebe wandering on some plesiosaurushaunted Oolitic coral reef orbeside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age Or did he goforward into one of the nearer ages in which men are still men butwith the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problemssolved Into the manhood of the race for I for my own part cannotthink that these latter days of weak experiment fragmentary theoryand mutual discord are indeed mans culminating time I say for my ownpart He I knowfor the question had been discussed among us longbefore the Time Machine was madethought but cheerlessly of theAdvancement of Mankind and saw in the growing pile of civilisationonly a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroyits makers in the end If that is so it remains for us to live asthough it were not so But to me the future is still black and blankisa vast ignorance lit at a few casual places by the memory of hisstory And I have by me for my comfort two strange whiteflowersshrivelled now and brown and flat and brittleto witness
